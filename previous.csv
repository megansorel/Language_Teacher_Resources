nb0592,how common is it to not have your country's most widely spoken language as any of your mother languages?,3,"/r/titlegoretaken spain as a whole, the most widely spoken language is spanish, it's also the only official language in all parts of spain. however there are many parts of spain where there are other official languages. in some places, spanish is not the mother language of some children. this can be the case for immigrant families who teach their children e.g. french, armenian, german, arabic, ukranian, dutch, until they're old enough to go to school. however even before going to school, they often acquire a passive knowledge of the language of their autonomous community through cartoons and television or playing in the playground. but this is also true for the official languages. so for example, my friend was born in the 70s and didn't speak spanish until he was 12. basque is his first language. i know of very similar cases in the 21st century, recently i was reading a tweet from a parent who had taken his 9 year old daughter to the doctors. normally they have a basque speaking doctor but the new one didn't speak basque, so he had to act as a translator for his daughter who is monolingual in basque. basque language rights are constantly infringed like this. recently a redditor told me this  when i asked basque redditors about possible cases of interference between the two languages, between their basque and their french or spanish.>gutxi, egia esan. gaztelania klasean ikasi nuen eta unibertsitatera heldu arte ez nuen asko erabiltzen. ez dut inoiz biak nahasteko joera izan, bizkaierazko erdarakadak salbu.very little to be honest. i learned spanish at school and i didn't use it a lot until i went to university. i never have the habit of mixing the two, unless you count the spanish loanwords in my dialect of basque.in your countries how common is it to not have your country's most widely spoken language as one of your mother languages?",3,2021-05-12 21:37:16,2021-05-13 01:20:57.717158,0 days 03:43:41.717163,1,"[""About 40% of the population speaks French.

It's hard for me to separate my opinion of him from my (very negative) opinion of monarchy, but the King seems fine. He's like a lovable, slightly awkward uncle. He's dyslexic, likes to crack jokes, can drop by a pizzeria and is pretty good at not appearing to be a posh, stuck-up royal.\n\nI definitely respect that he's graceful and respectful of the constitutional reform of 1974. The current King took throne when the monarch still had, on paper, a lot of power, it just wasn't exercised by convention. Then shortly after, there was a constitutional reform and since 1975 the Swedish monarch has no power even on paper. He doesn't appoint the government, he's not part of the government, he doesn't sign laws or appoint judges. This separates the Swedish system from e.g. the UK, Netherlands or Spain.\n\nA key part of the King's job is to be a unifying figure in difficult times, and he also does a good job with that. In the huge 2004 tsunami, hundreds of Swedes died, the King made a great speech. His speech as the current pandemic began was good. He's also good at avoiding political statements, even though many journalists try to ask the King's opinion on something, I don't recall him making anything other than very general statements.""]",18

what age does this start?3. do you recite the ""pledge of allegiance"" each morning at school?4. do you have ""morning announcements"" at school, over a tannoy and done by fellow students?5. do you have this school president position held by a student? does this tend to be held by a popular kid?6. do you actually have summer camps where you send your kids for the summer break?7. are proms as ostentatious as they are on tv?8. when you go to college to study and stay in dorms do you have to share a bedroom with another student, someone who is chosen for you and you have no input on?9. is college american football games as big an event as it seems? like aired on local tv channels and games drawing crowds in the 1000's? they seem to have a following as strong as premier league football in the uk?10. at college house parties do you all use 11. do you have police detectives that are paired up like bad boys for example? do these detectives often operate without uniform and use civilian vehicles?12. it seems like the nation is politically torn between hard left or hard right parties. i.e. republican vs democrat, and these seemingly are the only choices. is there little support for a centrist party that would seem like the logical choice? i understand the republicans are very hard right and the democrats are actually more right-centre comparing to uk politics.13. is it just a case of winner takes all during your elections? if it is a close race, with no party gaining  after the election, do you not get 14. without a monarch or a representative cultural figurehead as your head of state , instead having just an elected official in place for a short term , it seems like you all have a huge allegiance and feeling of duty to protect an inanimate object i.e. your flag. as a brit i somewhat experience such protective allegiance towards my queen but do not extend the same to the union jack or st georges flag, to the contrary, the latter flag of england has drawn negative connotations recently after being adopted by some  if a british flag was burnt in a protest i wouldn't be that bothered, however, it seems if an american flag is burnt in protest you yanks consider this high treason?15. do you only get two weeks of vacation a year as a minimum standard at work? is there actually a legal minimum?16. are you as gun mad as you seem? is it that easy for anyone to just purchase a serious piece of kit like an ar-15 or pistol?17. do you put cheese on pretty much every meal? and what the hell is up with the popularity of this fake cheese 18. is your town centres filled with fast food or diner joints, rather than having a good choice of fine dining restaurants? it seems like you are all about quantity over quality?19. is scotch whisky considered an exotic and premium beverage to you? even brands like bells?20. in your trendy bars ""downtown"" do people tend to drink cocktail drinks like martinis rather than bottles of wine or short mixers like a gin and tonic?21. pubs are the cultural epicentre to most villages/towns in the uk, where most events are held and whole families regularly meet up as a frequent social interaction. pubs or bars/taverns in the usa are portrayed very differently, it seems like they are adult-only areas usually seen as a place used exclusively by alcoholics/drunkards/down and outs. is this what they really are like?22. do you have no drinking culture over there at all? of course in the uk we are famous for our binge drinking antics, which is nothing to be proud of, but the us seem to take this to the opposite extreme. college students are seen to be getting wasted in films all the time but the middle-aged family man is depicted as a stay at home beer drinker having a few on a weekend may be having a few friends round to watch ""the game"". in the uk it is more likely that these middle-aged family men would still go to pub to watch the game with their friends and usually take their kids with them. this seems a big no-no in the usa?23. even with the college and younger folks in the usa drinking, seemingly they do this at house parties rather than a local bar? and when i visited the us the americans i was out with would have a drink then a shot and this would be them ready to go out clubbing. in the uk we would probably preload 5-6 drinks at least before venturing out.24. is crystal meth as big a problem as it looks?25. is ""tipping"" as big of a thing as people think? is it rude to not leave a tip? how much should you tip? if i just buy a pint of beer, what would i be expected to tip? leaving one dollar equating to circa 25% of the full price seems a lot? whereas tipping $10 dollars after a full night and an $80 tab feels sufficient? how do you tip now everything is paid by card?26. is the american independence/revolution or american civil war taught more prolifically in history classes than say the events of the two world wars?27. during history classes, when learning about the world wars, how is the usa's delayed involvement in both wars taught?28. does every american buy a huge car like ? and is motoring that cheap in the us that even the youngest drivers can afford to buy and run a sedan/saloon as their first car? do you even have super-compact and cheap cars like 29. is it common for you to have roads within your city centres that are 4-6 lanes wide plus parking spaces on either side of the road? in the uk we would be lucky to have more than 1-2 lane wide roads in our city centres, most now have been shut completely and pedestrianised.30. is the less tax pricing everywhere? how do you deal with this every day? why are the sales taxes not just shown on the list price?31. do you all have air conditioning or warm air heating in your houses? do you not have gas central heating or combi boilers?32. do you actually get houses 33. is thanksgiving as big a family event as christmas day?34. is it the norm to use 35. why is your bread all super sweet? surely a blt sandwich cannot taste nice on bread that tastes like it has been dipped in sugar?36. do you put syrup on breakfast food like bacon and sausage?37. you seem to embrace pretty much anything as a regular table condiment, even things that shouldn't be, offering pretty much every sauce in existence if requested at a restaurant. all sauces apart from  that you cannot buy for love nor money in america.38. after watching a few episodes myself and  it feels like americans will take each other to court over the smallest issue. is the country the overly litigious, lawyer filled country it looks to be?these are the ones i can think of at the moment probably plenty more!",848,2021-05-07 01:57:07,2021-05-13 01:24:14.824778,5 days 23:27:07.824784,0,[],1459

Here's a few quirky examples:\n\n**- abdecken:** Meaning 1: To uncover, reveal or take things away from a surface such as a table. Meaning 2: To cover up, hide.\n\n**- anhalten:** Meaning 1: To stop. Meaning 2: To continue\n\n**- aufheben:** Meaning 1: To take away, lift off (such as a ban or a sanction). Meaning 2: To keep, to store (such as a precious family heirloom).\n\n**- dämmern:** Meaning 1: To dawn, to become bright. Meaning 2: To dusk, to become dark.\n\n**- umfahren:** Meaning 1: To drive around something/someone, to avoid something/someone. Meaning 2: To hit and run over something/someone.\n\n**- Untiefe:** Meaning 1: A shallow area of a lake or a sea. Meaning 2: A great depth in a lake or a sea.\n\n**- gewiss:** Meaning 1: With certainty, doubtlessly. Meaning 2: Presumably, maybe.\n\nI really like this stuff but for German learners it's super tricky and German has hundreds of these words lol.\n\nAnother strange and tricky thing about German is that a verb can completely change its meaning according to what prefix it is given. For example: *verlassen*, *belassen*, *erlassen*, *hinlassen*, *durchlassen*, *gelassen*, *entlassen*, *oblassen*, *unterlassen*, *auslassen*, *einlassen*, *anlassen*, *offenlassen*, *dalassen*, *weglassen*, *dazulassen*, *hinterlassen* and *fortlassen* all have completely different meanings.

They were fed copious amounts of sweets, some which was not available commercially but specially formulated toffee to make it stick better to teeth, which resulted in many of them having their teeth completely ruined.

mztd9i,constitution month: twenty-seventh amendment,34,"the latest amendment to our constitution, ratified in 1992, reads:>no law, varying the compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, shall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened.or in plain english, ""any increases in pay authorized by congress for themselves shall not take effect until the next congress meets.""you may notice that this amendment uses an older style of english that seems anachronus for an amendment added only 29 years ago. this is because the 27th amendment was amongst the original bill of rights proposed and passed by congress in 1789 and sent to the states for ratification. with 202 years, 7 months, and 10 days between its proposal and its ratification; it is the amendment with the longest ratification period. the second-longest? the 22nd with 3 years and 343 days.the purpose behind the amendment is straightforward: congress is authorized to set their own pay. the 1st congress realized that the power that they had been given only two years previous could be used to fleece the taxpayers. so they proposed to provide at least some buffer by ensuring that pay increases could not take effect until after congress faced reelection.the states at the time did not feel that this was a significant concern: only maryland, north carolina, south carolina, and delaware initially ratified. 4/13, well short of the 10 states at the time required to ratify an amendment. vermont, virginia, and kentucky would ratify within the next few years; still short of the 3/4 requirement for ratification.and then, nothing.ohio would ratify the amendment in 1873 and wyoming in 1978, but otherwise the 27th would remain largely forgotten.until 1982 when of a university of texas at austin student named gregory watson wrote a paper for his political science class arguing that since there is no sunset clause in this amendment, it could still be ratified by the states. he would receive a c on this paper from the class' ta, the appeal to receive a better grade for which was denied by watson's professor.in what can only be described as one of the greatest retaliations in american history, watson began a letter-writing campaign to the states' legislatures informing them of their ability to ratify this amendment.watson's letter campaign took place at the perfect time: from the latter half of the 1970s into the early 1990s, congress had been giving themselves pay raises with much more frequency than they had in decades previous. public consciousness and distaste of congress setting their own salary was higher than it had ever been. states' legislatures, now armed with the knowledge that the congressional portion of an amendment to somewhat curb this conflict of interest had already been passed, began a flurry of ratification. maine was the first to take action in response to watson's letter campaign in 1983. in 1992, the michigan legislature ratified the 27th amendment. the archivist of congress certified that the 27th article of amendment to the united states constitution had been ratified and would be put into force.since its ratification, congress has increased the pay for the incoming congress eleven times. the last time that congress has raised pay for the next congress was 2009: the current salary for a member of congress is $174,000 per year.",43,2021-04-27 17:12:28,2021-05-13 01:30:03.827800,15 days 08:17:35.827807,0,"[""This Amendment is just one man's wild ride to academic legend.

mumh7t,constitution month: the twentieth amendment,4,"you can view the entire constitution month series  using .  -this one has six sections, so i'll do a short analysis of each section as we go through them.> the terms of the president and vice president shall end at noon on the 20th day of january, and the terms of senators and representatives at noon on the 3d day of january, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin.> the congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of january, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.why did they change when these terms start? in the case of presidents, it was to shorten the lame duck session, since communication had sped up significantly in a century and half. in the case of congress, it was to remove the ""short session"", which had been kind of a recurring headache.why did we need an amendment for this? well, while the constitution doesn't say when congressional terms begin, it does say how long they are. and since changing the start date would change the length of the then-current terms  well, we can only override the constitution by amending it. > if, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the president, the president elect shall have died, the vice president elect shall become president. if a president shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his term, or if the president elect shall have failed to qualify, then the vice president elect shall act as president until a president shall have qualified; and the congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a president elect nor a vice president elect shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as president, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person shall act accordingly until a president or vice president shall have qualified.tying into the above change of starting dates, note that the new congress starts up before the president, and this section digs into part of why that should be. note the line ""at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the president"" - it will be the new congress deciding, not the old, possibly voted-out one. this was a change designed to prevent a hypothetical problem - but a problem that would surely have been very troubling had it occurred. i think, given our contemporary election troubles, it was a wise change to make - can you even imagine the alternative?> the congress may by law provide for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the house of representatives may choose a president whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them, and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the senate may choose a vice president whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them.now, maybe i'm not reading this right, but this seems like a big, carefully worded ""tbd"" on the order of succession - basically saying this part will be decided by congress passing laws at a later date. > sections 1 and 2 shall take effect on the 15th day of october following the ratification of this article.these were the ones changing the start dates, if you weren't paying attention.> this article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission.unlike other amendments, this one had a time limit. if you recall from last week, some of the reconstruction amendments took a very long time to be ratified.  -so the temptation is to label this amendment as ""messing around with clocks"", and it's not entirely unfair. but as matters go, this was a very pragmatic and noncontroversial amendment -it has never been the subject of a supreme court decision- one designed to deal with a few specific problems in one beneficent swoop: the long lame-duck period of outgoing presidents; the fractious and hurried short session of congress; and the succession of the presidency if someone died, or went to jail, or was found to actually be a small group of children in a trenchcoat, between the election and the inauguration.so maybe it's better to think of it as a modernizing amendment, one designed to acknowledge the ways in which changing communication and transit technology had sped up the life-cycle of our federal government.at the time, the senate committee on the judiciary had this to say:> when our constitution was adopted there was some reason for such a long intervention of time between the election and the actual commencement of work by the new congress  under present conditions the result of elections is known all over the country within a few hours after the polls close, and the capital city is within a few days’ travel of the remotest portions of the country.it's worth noting that the chair of that committee, sen. norris, was a sponsor of the amendment as it was eventually passed.",15,2021-04-20 09:20:14,2021-05-13 01:35:27.016493,22 days 16:15:13.016500,0,['Wow'],890

""speakeasies"", which were unauthorized establishments selling alcohol, flourished, and a new culture developed around them. all of these issues led to growing calls for repealing the 18th amendment, which happened in 1933 with the ratification of the 21st amendment.",31,2021-04-18 16:45:12,2021-05-13 01:36:44.050122,24 days 08:51:32.050130,0,"['Prohibition is a fascinating time in US history, and I recommend anyone interested in politics or history to really learn about it.

It's a monthly payment for people who, for social reasons (such as unemployment, other reasons are available), are unable to provide for themselves and their families. The amount varies, depending on whether or not you have children to provide for as well, so, a single parent with two kids gets more than a single person without kids, as an example. There are some somewhat strict rules, and it is kinda easy to lose the payment. 

The private system is the _a-kasser_. Traditionally started and run by trade unions, as a system of solidarity, nowadays there are many 'independent' a-kasser that function as insurance companies. Disregarding the latter type, a-kasser basically function like a big solidarity piggy-bank, where workers join together funds, in order to, if one of the members should lose their income, either because they were fired or sick or stuff like that. These are paid on a daily basis, for 2 years, and in olden days, you'd have to go to the house of your local trade union rep, and they'd pay you in cash, from a physical box. In smaller towns without a dedicated trade union office, you can still find special doors made for the union reps, with either like a teller-stall build into the door itself, or at least build into the building somewhere.

One common theme that I had among my climates was a feeling of almost disappointment. Not that the US was worse than they thought it would be, just that it was simply another place. A lot of people tend to view the US as some larger-than-life country where everything is always exciting and happening all at once, the reality is a bit slower and a lot quieter.

Heres the Standard advice I gave everybody:

* Research where you'll be moving, the US is massively diverse, with huge potential differences even within the same state. A suburb in Massachusetts will be quite different from a suburb in Georgia. A farm town in Vermont is going to feel like a different country than a city on the west coast. Everything from culture to politics to food to weather to manners to history to simple geography can all vary immensely.

* Be open-minded, things may not always be what they seem

* Remember, TV is not real life, things are very rarely how they're portrayed in media, real life tends to be a lot more boring

* Research the weather, don't move to NY and expect it to be warm, don't move to Georgia if you want a white Christmas

* Ask yourself, why do you want to move to the US? Not that you shouldn't, but I'd encourage you to think what you'll be improving by coming here",49

msu6pz,constitution month: the 17th amendment,56,">the senate of the united states shall be composed of two senators from each state, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each senator shall have one vote. the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures.  >  >when vacancies happen in the representation of any state in the senate, the executive authority of such state shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: provided, that the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.  >  >this amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the constitution.the 17th amendment took effect on april 8, 1913 and superseded article i, section 3 of the constitution and changed the process of the selection of senators from that of the state legislatures to that of direct popular vote within the states.  the transition of every senator being elected was complete by march 4, 1919. the ideas of changing the selection of senators to direct popular vote was not a modern idea at the time.  the idea had been floated on and off thorough the 1800's.  there was a sense that the position of senator was a position that could be easily corrupted with the seat being bought and sold for favors.  this lead to the belief that those that became senators were not always the most qualified candidate. another concern was deadlock.  due to senators having to be selected by the state legislators, agreement was not always expedient and there were several instances where states did not have representation in the senate because the elected members of the legislature could not agree on whom to select for the senate seat.  this became more common in the 1850's as tensions grew between the pro-slavery and anti-slavery crowds. in 1866, congress took action and passed laws to try and prevent deadlock.  the new requirement forced state legislatures to to meet severalty and vote for a candidate.  then the two houses would convene.  if it was found that both houses had selected the same person, that person became the next senator for that state.  if the houses didn't agree, then they were to have a vote on the candidates that each house had selected.  if they did not come to an agreement they were to meet the next day and have another vote.  the joint sessions were to occur every day until a decision was reached.  this process was found the be somewhat helpful but there were still  46 instances of deadlock  between 1899 and 1903 in 20 states. in once instance, a senate seat from delaware  went unfilled from 1899 to 1903.  the first attempts to try and change the constitution occurred in 1826, 1829, and 1855.  all of these attempts failed.  the first step to reform occurred in the 1860's with the passage of a group of laws from congress to dictate the voting process of the state legislatures. in the 1890's the move for reform grew to becoming part of the platform of reform parties.  the populist party , began to push for a change to direct popular vote of the senators.  they achieved some success by when they instituted this change within their party with the omaha platform .  in 1908 both oregon and nebraska had added popular votes as their way of selecting senators for the state legislator to approve.  by the time of the amendment proposal 10 states had some form of formal or informal primary process to select senators before the legislature decided. the call for a constitutional amendment began to grow and by 1910 the house was in favor of such reform and 31 states had passed resolutions calling for an amendment to change the system.  in 1911, the house passed joint resolution 39 proposing an amendment to the constitution to be by direct popular election.  the original resolution had some issues though as it contained the ""race-rider"" provision that would have allowed states to continue to disenfranchise black and poor white voters.  when the resolution went to the senate, a resolution was proposed without the rider. the amended resolution passed the senate and went back to the house.  the house accepted the change a year later and sent the conference report to the senate.  the senate approved the conference report on april 12, 1912 and the house on may 13, 1912. at this point the resolution went to the states for ratification. by april 8, 1913 36 states had ratified the amendment.  secretary of state william jennings bryan certified the results on may 31, 1913 and the amendment was added to the constitution.  only 5 more states would ratify the amendment with louisiana in 1914, alabama in 2002, delaware in 2010, maryland in 2012, and rhode island in 2014.  utah rejected the amendment and has never ratified the amendment. and no action has been taken on the amendment by florida, mississippi, georgia, kentucky, south carolina, virginia, alaska, and hawaii . while the amendment has not been as controversial or litigated as much as other amendments, it has had its hurdles. there has been a push to amend the amendment and remove the provision giving the executive the state to fill vacancies and there have been some cases regarding this aspect of it.  after the election of president obama and the controversies and crimes associated with rob blagojevich emerged, there was a small bipartisan effort to pass and amendment removing the potion of the 17th that gave the executive the authority to fill vacancies.  there has also been a growing movement to repeal the amendment in its entirety.  utah in 2016 passed a resolution asking for congress to repeal the amendment.  since then, there have been calls by some conservatives to repeal the amendment including mike huckabee and senator ben sasse.  at this point however, there is not enough political drive or social pressure to have any real effect on this amendment. tl;drthe 17th amendment changed the selection of senators from selection by the the state legislatures to direct popular vote in elections and by executive selection when filling a vacancy.",17,2021-04-17 16:44:18,2021-05-13 23:42:51.896893,26 days

I literally haven't ever heard of ""tutorials"" before, so I really can't tell you how legit they are. You'd have to post some links so I could give them a look.

*I DO KNOW* that theres some dishonest stuff about gold panning and sluice boxes out there. Guys will take the finding from a few days or weeks and add them to the concentrate to give unrealistic expectations for how much you can expect to find in a single run. We had what was considered a fairly productive claim for only being able to use hand tools, and it was pretty typical for us to find less than a gram of gold between 3 people panning and sluicing for an entire weekend. When you do find gold its usually in amounts so small that you need an eyedropper to remove it from the pan. Finding something big enough to pick up with tweezers is a good day, and something big enough to pick up with fingers is cause for celebration. Most commercial operations run many, many tons of concentrate through industrial equipment to yield maybe an ounce a ton, and that would be a functionally productive commercial claim. A few of the really REALLY rich claims can run an ounce or two per ton of concentrate, and those are fairly uncommon.

Also, theres these kits you can buy that ""garuntee"" that you will find a certain amount per kit. Its usually a bag of dirt and gravel with like, $15 worth of gold flakes mixed in that you can try to pan out. We've run a few through our sluice over the years out of curiosity to see if they are real or a scam. The truth is mixed.

> State government-chartered and -owned corporations are numerous and provide public services. Examples include North Dakota Mill and Elevator and South Dakota Public Broadcasting. Generally speaking, a statute passed by a state legislature specifically sets up a government-owned company in order to undertake a specific public purpose with public funds or public property. Lotteries in the United States are also run by government corporations, such as the Georgia Lottery Corporation and many others.

So yes, I believe so. With the condition that the company has something to do with serving the people in one way or another. Even then it has to go through an approval process.

race, color, or previous condition of servitude.  >  >section 2  >  >the congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.&#x200b;the 15th amendment was the third and final reconstruction amendment.  ratified on february 3, 1870, the 15th amendment secured the right to vote for the recently freed slaves.  however, as all slavery related laws and topics go, the amendment was not that simple, nor was its enforcement rigid.related to the 14th amendment, the 15th amendment began to be formulated based on the concern that democrats would increase their seats in the house by being able to count all newly freed slaves as 1 whole person .  john bingham, the primary author of the 14th amendment, wanted a clear and wide-ranging ban on suffrage limitations.  but his proposals were rejected at the time as getting the 14th amendment passed was contentious enough.  you also had the factor that there was worry that a non-specific universal suffrage would allow foreign born citizens and the chinese on the west coast to vote. something that many politicians had issue with based on their regional relationship to those specific groups. this worry led to the compromise that the 15th amendment would only address voting rights based on race, color, and former condition of servitude.  the amendment specifically did not address issues such as poll taxes and bars to voting to make sure it received the widest amount of support.  however, on february 25, 1869 the house passed the resolution with the senate following the next day. the proposed amendment now went to the states where it faced major hurdles. several groups took issue with the amendment including the women's suffrage movement who had been allies of the abolitionist prior to the start and during the civil war. nonetheless, states began to ratify the amendment with nevada being the first.  most new england and midwest states followed and some southern states under the control of reconstruction governments also quickly ratified the amendment .  there was still pushback from some of the southern states however and in april and december of 1869, congress passed laws requiring virginia, mississippi, texas, and georgia to ratify the amendment in order to be allowed back into the union with full representation.  all four states did ratify the amendment and by january, 20 states had ratified the amendment.  on january 5th though, new york attempted to rescind their ratification, but by february 18, 1870, enough states had ratified the amendment and put an end to any court challenges to the change of new york's vote. on march 30, 1870 the amendment was certified and added to the constitution.  the remaining states from that time would eventually ratify the amendment with tennessee being the final state to ratify in 1997.  it was not smooth sailing after the certification of the amendment however.  several states and paramilitary entities attempted to interfere and deny african americans their right to vote. congress would pass the enforcement acts between 1870 and 1871 to enforce the amendment, but those laws were weakened as reconstruction came to an end. another early blow to the enforcement of the amendment came in 1876 in the case  united states v. reese .  this was the first supreme court decision in regards to the 15th amendment with the court interpreting the amendment narrowly and upholding voting restrictions such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses.  the court wrote: >the fifteenth amendment does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone. it prevents the states, or the united states, however, from giving preference, in this particular, to one citizen of the united states over another on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. before its adoption, this could be done. it was as much within the power of a state to exclude citizens of the united states from voting on account of race, &c., as it was on account of age, property, or education. now it is not. if citizens of one race having certain qualifications are permitted by law to vote, those of another having the same qualifications must be. previous to this amendment, there was no constitutional guaranty against this discrimination: now there is. it follows that the amendment has invested the citizens of the united states with a new constitutional right which is within the protecting power of congress. that right is an exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. this, under the express provisions of the second section of the amendment, congress may enforce by ""appropriate legislation""the battle to obtain and secure the rights and liberties ensconced in this amendment would be battled all the way through the jim crow era and finally lead to the passage of the 24th amendment , and eventually the voting rights act of 1965 which furthered equality for african americans.  the 15th amendment is still referenced in case law to this day and was used in 2013 to strike down some aspects of the voting rights act of 1965 in  shelby county v. holder .  like all the other reconstruction amendments, the 15th amendment was a political solution to a new 'problem' created by the union victory over the confederacy and unfortunately, it has had to be defended and litigated to secure the rights that it set out to secure.   tl;drthe 15th amendment is the final reconstruction amendment and states that the rights of citizens to vote shall not be denied based on race, color, or your previous condition of servitude.  it was a compromise amendment that had some major lapses and left open the ability of some states to find ways to deny people the right to vote.  it has persevered through the ages and has been used to help secure further rights for african americans, even if at times it has been used to hinder that expansion.",19,2021-04-15 06:36:48,2021-05-13 23:43:45.841998,28 days 17:06:57.842005,0,I don't really have much to add other than Georgia has done a fantastic job of immediately

one of the most consequential amendments in the constitution. the amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protections under the law as a direct result of the freeing of the slaves and how to deal with the new influx of freed people in the country.  unlike the 13th amendment which has never been litigated nor is it rarely used in case law, the 14th amendment, and especially section 1, is one of the most litigated sections in any of the amendments to date. section 1 of the 14th amendment has been used in famous landmark cases, including:  brown vs  board of education ,  roe vs wade, bush vs gore,  and  obergefell vs hodges .following the passage of the 13th amendment, congressional republicans started to get concerned that the new freed population would increase the representation of the southern states, even if those states disenfranchised those same freedmen to not vote or participate in elections.  working to abridge this action by the southern states and to prevent the southern democrats from gaining an overwhelming majority in the house, republicans pushed and achieved the passage of the civil rights act of 1866.  this law guaranteed citizenship regardless of race, color, and previous status as a slave or involuntary servitude. the act also gave equal benefits under the law.fearful that congress would struggle to pass laws in relation to the civil rights act, republicans and moderate democrats began to look for a more permanent and constitutional power to guarantee the rights of african americans in this country.  after more than 70 proposals were provided to the committee, the joint committee on reconstruction offered its 3rd proposal for a 14th amendment in april of 1866. the proposal was a compromise that addressed republican concerns over the treatment of freed slaves, but also addressed issues of confederate debt and ex-confederate voting rights.  congress passed this proposal several weeks later and sent it off to the senate.  the senate debated the resolution and several amendments were proposed and adopted.  on june 8, 1866 the senate passed the modified resolution and sent it back to the house. on june 13, 1866 the congress accepted the modified resolution and passed a separate resolution requesting president johnson send the resolution out to the states.the amendment was sent to the states for ratification with every ex-confederate state, except tennessee, refusing to ratify it.  congress then passed the reconstruction acts, which promptly led to the removal of the existing governments in the ex-confederate states and supplanted them with military governments.  these military governments were to remain in place until new civil governments could be created.  congress then passed a law in march of 1867 requiring the former confederate states to ratify the 14th amendment before their new civil governments would be accepted and before those states could be represented in congress.on july 9, 1868 south carolina became the 28th state to ratify the amendment, however there was a problem.  democrats had retaken the state legislatures in both ohio and new jersey and rescinded their previous approval of the amendment.  that left the amendment at 26 states instead of 28.  this lead to a lot of controversy, but other states ratified the amendment while the debates and arguments about the legitimacy of ohio's and new jersey's actions were debated. in july of 1868, georgia ratified the 14th amendment making it the ""28th"" state to do so .  on july 27, 1868 william seward certified georgia's ratification and thus proclaimed that the 14th amendment had been adopted and was now part of the constitution. by this time, congress had determined that the rescission by ohio and new jersey were illegitimate and those states were kept in the official role making the ratification total 30.  this however never solved the issue and the question of rescission and whether or not a state can do that is still to be officially determined.  ohio and new jersey eventually did re-ratify the amendment in 2003, thus the amendment was ratified by every state that existed during this time of reconstruction.this amendment contains several clauses that are important to case law that is still debated to this day.  so while the goal of this amendment was to secure the rights and liberties of the newly freed slave population, along with answering some questions in regards to ex-confederates, this amendment has had far reaching consequences that are still debated, referenced and talked about to this day.tl;drthe 14th amendment was another reconstruction amendment that worked to guarantee the rights of the newly freed slave population in this country.  as with all things slavery, it wasn't that simple and the was a long battle with controversy and intrigue that has left unanswered questions to this day.  the scope of this amendment is so important that it has been used in many landmark cases and is still widely used and debated in our courts to this day.",24,2021-04-14 06:51:38,2021-05-13 23:44:16.177348,29 days 16:52:38.177355,0,"People often think of jus soli

-----

Before the 14th Amendment, there was no concept of an American citizen. You were only a citizen of your State …maybe. Each State set its own citizenship laws. These were varied -- citizenship and the rights associated with citizenship were not guaranteed. The 14th 1) establishes that there is a United States citizenship and 2) that a United States citizen is *automatically* a citizen of the State in which they reside.

This has led some 150 years later to persons forgetting that State citizenship even exists. I've seen commenters on this sub state (and get upvoted!) that there is no such thing as State citizenship.

mpv55p,constitution month: the 13th amendment,28,">section 1  >  >neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the united states, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.  >  >section 2  >  >congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.&#x200b;the thirteenth amendment is the first of the reconstruction amendments passed at the conclusion of the civil war.this amendment is different from previous amendments as it started out as a proclamation made by abraham lincoln using his executive branch war powers.  the emancipation proclamation was an executive order issued by lincoln on september 22, 1862 following the union 'victory' at antietam.  the emancipation proclamation took effect on january 1, 1863.&#x200b;>that on the first day of january in the year of our lord, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any state, or designated part of a state, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the executive government of the united states, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.the emancipation proclamation freed all slaves within the csa. this is a very important asterisk that gets left out in a lot of history.  at its issuance, the eo did very little to change the status of most slaves in the us on only a very small number were freed upon its issuance. however, the emancipation proclamation historically changed the tone of the war and the overall end goals of the union government.  the union army would now free any slave that reached their lines without any compensation to the former slave owners.  the last state to be effected by the emancipation proclamation was texas when union forces entered and occupied the state on june 19th, 1865 .the end of the war did not free all of the slaves though.  kentucky and delaware where union held border states when the emancipation proclamation entered effect and thus the slaves in those states where not freed. the thirteenth amendment would be passed to officially abolish slavery in the entire united states and all of its territories.on april 8, 1864 the thirteenth amendment passed the senate 38 to 6. however, the house failed to pass the motion with only 93 members of the house supporting the amendment and 65 voting against . on december 6, 1864 lincoln urged the lame duck house to pass the amendment during his state of the union after his reelection. on january 31, 1865 the house called another vote.  after heavy pressure from lincoln and republicans , 119 congressmen voted for the passage of the amendment after an initial false start that saw members not reaching the 2/3 requirement.  the joint resolution was then sent to lincoln to sign, who signed it ""approved"" even though he had no constitutional obligation to do so, nor was it required.  congress then passed a resolution on february 7, 1865 reaffirming that the president did not need to, nor was required to sign the joint resolution.  that makes the 13th amendment the only ratified amendment to be signed by a president.by february 1, 1865 the amendment went to the states for ratification.  at that time there were 36 states in the us .  27 states would need to ratify the amendment for it to come into force. by the end of february, 18 states had ratified the amendment, including two former rebellious states, virginia and louisiana.  soon arkansas and tennessee ratified the amendment.  this brought up an issue though.  how many of the formerly rebellious states had legal legislatures at this time.  this led to the discussion of if article v required 3/4 of the states or 3/4 of the legally recognized legislatures to ratify the amendment. on april 11, 1865 lincoln gave a speech in which he said, that the southern states were not in their normal relationship with the union and the country should do what it can to rectify that.  three days later, lincoln was assassinated and his vice president, andrew johnson, became president of the united states.at this point, johnson started down a different path of reconstruction and began to negotiate with the formally rebellious states in order to get them back into the union and to get the amendment passed.  these negotiations went so far as to tell the governors of mississippi and north carolina that they would be able to put laws that would limit the freedoms of freed slaves if they agreed to pass this amendment. several states took issue with the second clause feeling that it gave congress overreaching powers over their sovereignty.  seward would say that the second clause is there to restrict congress, not give it the powers that the southern states feared.  in november 1865, south carolina ratified the amendment, but passed a resolution stating that, ""any attempt by congress toward legislating upon the political status of former slaves, or their civil relations, would be contrary to the constitution of the united states.""  in december, alabama, georgia, and north carolina ratified the amendment giving it the 27 states required to come into force.on the 18th of december, william seward proclaimed that the amendment had been ratified and was now officially part of the constitution.  seward accepted the votes from the three states that had ratified the amendment but with the additional resolutions, and ignored those resolutions. the remaining states subsequently ratified the amendment with delaware ratifying it in 1901, kentucky in 1976, and mississippi in 1995.tl;drthe amendment started out as the emancipation proclamation.  took a while for congress to get on board.  took even longer and a lot of sketchiness to get enough states to ratify it.  and is basically a microcosm of the entire slavery question battle all rolled into the passage of one amendment.",21,2021-04-13 04:33:30,2021-05-13 23:44:41.823911,30 days 19:11:11.823918,0,"I love this one just because of how differently it is written.

Totalled my car and got bad whiplash, but otherwise I was fine. I was the first car in the pileup and I was insanely lucky. The family left their car in neutral so this huge truck behind me slammed into it and shot their suv forward, smacking their 12 year old kid with it.

My insurance took my statement, and then about a month or so later they told me the family was suing me, as well as everyone involved in the wreck. I guess parking in the passing lane on a 70 mph high way and leaving the SUV in neutral for some reason, in the middle of a snow storm, did not bode well for their insurance payments.

I had to do nothing tho, which was nice. They told me they had everything they needed from me and letting me know about the lawsuit was just a formality. I guess it is common to sue others involved in a car accident when the insurance payouts are less than expected (they didn't get a lot since they basically caused the whole thing).

Sometimes the solar farms can be a good deal for farmers.  I think some solar farms take something like a 30 year lease on farm land rather than buying the land.

If you don’t know the culture enough to understand the expectation, then you won’t find it funny.

Comedy (other than physical
Comedy) is extremely hard to understand across cultures. For example, let’s say they are making fun of a person because they buy cheap beer. They don’t say “you are cheap! Your beer is cheap!” They say “wow, brand X... you’re really living it up” and Americans laugh because they know of Brand X as a cheap brand. but if you don’t know the reputation of Brand X you can’t perceive the joke. 

Also a LOT of American comedy is “wrong formality for the situation” with someone acting *either* too formal or not formal enough for the situation,’or using a regional dialect incorrectly or in an unexpected manner, or being far more specific than is necessary. Without some strong understanding of what the right formality would be, you can’t get the joke.

Tl;dr understanding the humor of other cultures usually requires a pretty intensive understanding of that culture

Unless you learn a LOT about American culture, you’re unlikely to find American comedy funny. But the reverse is also true, Americans probably cannot perceive Turkish jokes, unless they are extremely familiar with the culture.!",83

Why do many American workers resist unionization?


1) Unions in the US are supported by dues that come out of the members’ paychecks. Some Employees do not want to give their own money to an organization that they may not agree with politically. As the large national unions almost always support the Democratic Party, mostly Republican workers in Alabama may not like that.

2) Many people in the US that have experienced working in Union shops strongly dislike the way Union shops are run. Many have extremely annoying rules that won’t let workers do a trivial job that falls under another worker’s responsibilities. Such as, you can get in trouble with the union for jump starting a work truck without a union mechanic or moving a pallet out of the way without a union teamster. 

3) Unions in America tend to push for promotions and pay scales that are primarily based on seniority, and younger hard workers will often resent that an older lazy employee is making more than them. In some extreme cases, the unions have completely thrown the younger workers under the bus to protect their older members. 

4) Many American Unions were infiltrated by organized crime in the 20th century, and many basically operate like mafias. Employees that work against the union are harassed and are prone to have house fires. These corrupted Unions are typically rent-seeking organizations that primarily work to enrich themselves and their organizers, at the expense of both the company and the workers. 

5) American Unions are typically biased towards keeping jobs in the Northeast, Midwest, or West Coast in states where laws benefit the Unions the most. Many Southerners hold a grudge against Unions, because the Unions often work against bringing them jobs. This has not completely stopped either. Boeing workers in Seattle have gone on multiple strikes over the last decade because Boeing built a plant in South Carolina. Workers in Alabama will be far more resistant to unionization than workers in New York or Michigan. Many working-class Southerners are even proudly anti-union. 

6) Although modern Unions are typically strongly supportive of African-American workers, many Unions were extremely and blatantly racist in the early and mid 20th century. Many older African-Americans still distrust Unions, although younger African-Americans tend to be strongly pro-union.",8

Funerals are usually in the afternoon, at least from my experience. They work pretty much the same way in both Portugal and Spain, at least the ones I've attended. First you go to the vigil, which will many times be in a small building next to a church, especially in smaller towns. The family will be there until the church service or the trip to the cemetery. This is where people go to pay their respects.

Most funerals I've been to are open-casket (haven't been to one since COVID), which can be quite unpleasant if you're more sensitive. My grandfather had a closed casket funeral as he died from pneumonia, but for instance my grandmother was open-casket as she died from a heart attack. This is just my experience though, I'm from semiurban North/Central Portugal.

After that, there will be a short church service, if the family requests it. It doesn't normally go personal on the person, it's just a generic service for a dead person and they talk about common Bible themes about death. Then, there will be a procession to the cemetery, and the person will be buried in the corresponding grave. Some prayers will be made and that's about it. People will leave, and the family will stay behind for a bit longer.

I don't know how cremations work, everyone I know who's died has been buried. Never heard of anything like having a chosen song or something like that, either.",211

When I was living at home we were a family of 4 earning between 13k to 21k per year, depending on the year in question, so we were at, or well below the poverty line most of the time.

Didn't get much help. I was cold and hungry most of the time, although it could have been helped if my parent bought really cheap and poor quality food that would fill us up, but that just leads to more health problems, so less quantity for basic quality is what we went for.

University was free for me, and I was given a stipend which was also pittance. They give you something like €680 a month (there is no housing allowance so you have to use this to pay everything, including rent, which would be about €300-€350)... *but* only for 9 months of the year. (They pretend you don't exist for the 3 months of the summer.) So you have to spread it out over the 12 months by keeping your spending to about €500 a month and hope you're consistently lucky on the job market, otherwise you're a walking skeleton living off sandwiches. (500 minus 300 rent per month, leaves you 50 a week for all of the food, bills, clothes, college material, etc)

I don't know if I understand that correctly, but are you trying to say that if you want to study Medicine you have to study Biology first? Because that's nonsense, at least in Poland. If you want to study Medicine, you can start studying it just after graduating from high school if you pass high school final exams and you get accepted to the university. Nobody would give a fuck if you studied biology earlier, in fact some people would call that completely useless and a waste of time if you wanted to study Medicine in the first place.

The same is with Pharmacy, nobody gives a fuck if you studied Chemistry before, because it's completely useless except for some Chemistry basics in the first two years. I know two people who studied Chemistry for one year before getting accepted to the university in order to study Pharmacy, and the only advantage they had was the ability to solve mathematical exercises in chemistry subjects faster and more effectively than other students.

Of course, sometimes it's required to graduate from something related if you want to study something, for example in my university there are 2-year-long studies on Toxicology with elements of criminalistics, and you have to graduate first from something related to medical sciences (Medicine, Pharmacy, whatever), general sciences (e.g. Biology, Chemistry), agricultural sciences, or technical sciences.

mow56t,"how come in america and most of the world, people tend to divide time dedicated to sports to each season and change sports throughout the year as weather changes, but in europe soccer is played all year long despite the continental weather ?",33,"when i was reading the manga captain tsubasa, the japanese soccer youth teams was often surprising students all across japan because they played association football all year long from when the ground is covered in snow under cloudy skies to during the hot summer at the beach and while its raining during april. they received mockery from other japanese kids  for committing all their time to soccer instead of dividing the time to sports based at the time of the year in addition, touch which is a baseball manga, has the suepr star baseball student playing soccer off season at a team during the summer and another manga about basketball has the professional team taking time off and playing volleyball at the beach during the summer    .which reminds me of the american tradition of the big sports baseball, basketball, and football. for a long time the cliche was that the local jock would be playing football as the school year starts at fall, than switch to basketball as weather gets colder during winter months, and then start swinging bats at thrown baseballs as spring comes back with summer being either the time to practise your favorite sport or take a break and not do any activity just relaxing the whole summer or do conditioning like weightlifting or boxing and martial arts and some other hardcore training to prepare the body for the next school year. in recent years, soccer is slowly but gradually becoming the traditional ""4th"" big sport and athletes are now using summer to play on the soccer team thus completing 4 complete season of competitive school sports esp at the college level.now i notice in the rest of the world tend to follow the ""seasonal big 3"" . for example many african nations will play soccer during the summer and spring but change to track and field during the summer and maybe basketball during the winter depending if the country gets cold winters or very rainy weather during the november-february months.throughout asia its same to japan that people will change from soccer to basketball and whatever other sport is popular locally .so i'd have to ask    . how come in europe people getting into football tend to play it almost exclusively all year long? i get in say south america with the temperature being warm tropical all year long with a large parts of the year being sunny for months as to why people would do nothing but play soccer all year long esp the local equivalent of the ""super star jock"" archetype so comon in american movies and tv    but with europe having all 4 seasons, you'd think the equivalent of ""baseball spring, gridiron autumn, basketball winter, would exist and the super star athletes of a school would be rotating different sports for each season and be into a total of 3  sports they are really into  .. true some countries play nothing but football at the school and even college levels    .. and most european nations are so terrible at sports period there's not point in people trying to put big efforts into basketball or some other major international sport so they might as well just focus on whats already big, soccer  ..but even nations with their own big 3-4 sports have not just most super school and college athlete celebrity but even average joes focus exclusively on soccer all year long. the uk is infamous for inventing 3 of the biggest sports n the world  and thus like america has a ""big 3"" sports seen as the tradition for the quintessential brit. but despite that almost all focus is exclusively on football and there is no ""seasonal sports rotation"" tradition in the united kingdom the way the usa has. whole generations of brits can go through their whole life never playing or even watching a single rugby and cricket game but practically everybody who's a somebody had spent time kicking a football n childhood and watching a local game.even in countries in the continent that are known powerhouses for other sports like france with rugby and serbia with basketball, football is not only the handsdown dominant game and everyone plays it all year long but most people aren't interested at all watching other games on tv, even the championships, despite say greece winning gold medals in the past.so why is europe so unique in this regards as a place with continental weather? latin america has the excuse of being tropical and hot all year long, forms of football similar to rugby are the hands down monopoly in australia and new zealand so it makes sense for them not to do seasonal rotation or for people to be into multiple sports.but europe it seems people are so much into soccer they play it to insane levels even in uncomfortable times of the year like snowy winter or blazing hot summer with heat waves and temperatures reaching over 100 degrees f!!!!!!!i mean hockey is hands down the unquestionable dominant sport in canada yet canada still does the rotational sports tradition of ts own local ""big 3"" .even in other soccer dominant nations like thailand and egypt, many athletes play all the other major sports in addition to soccer albeit with much less intense focus compared to their fav . knew arab exchange students who after playing hard on the local college team during the afternoon, would cool down at evening by playing basketball or their other preferred sports and plenty of people in thailand do some committed degree of muay thai training in addition to playing soccer everyday and i can put plenty of more examples across the world.so why is europe so much an oddjob in this sports pattern? everywhere else in the world its the norm to change the current sport  depending on the time of the year or for star athletes to be big into multiple sports and play a their less preferred one to varying degrees while focusing most efforts on their favorite. in europe it seems even among physical monsters who are gifted athletically, very few play anything other than soccer, and games are played and shown on tv and radio all year long despite drastic seasonal changes.why is this?

Some might also know the president van der Bellen, but probably not as many. But since he was supported by the Green Party Germans saw it as a good sign as opposition to Kurz, so his nomination was well watched here. 

The UK prime minister is also always very prominent. Especially Boris Johnson and Theresa May were all over the news with Brexit. 

Orbán is also well known for his dictatorship attitudes and anti EU politics. 

After that it becomes difficult. You have it sometimes that some ministers become more prominent for some years like Berlusconi, but in general I don’t think most people know the current MP of Denmark or Greece.

It seems that McDonald's have killed their own mascot :D

E: Alright this one seems to be a bit of a rabbit hole. The English wiki page states only that they discontinued Ronald as a reaction to the Horror clown thing in 2016. But there is more to it.

E3:

So now I have the proper time to write it a bit more detailed.

I was on the fly so sorry for no link or source.

Here is a Segment from the English wiki:

>Critics claimed that a clown mascot targeting children for fast food is unethical. A group of 550 doctors took out newspaper ads in 2011, insisting Ronald McDonald retire.[33]
Ronald McDonald made fewer appearances in 2016 due to the 2016 clown sightings. However, he now continues to appear at live events, and on social media.[34]

And this is the part from the german wiki (I will just slamm it in a translator, sorry folks but I don't have the patience to translate it my self right now):

>In China, the figure of Ronald has repeatedly been the target of political attacks and vilification. In 2000, numerous demonstrators in Hong Kong dressed up as Ronald and carried signs and banners with political hostility on them. The background was citizen protests against McDonald's as a purported symbol of Western oppression and for allegedly promoting child labor.[1]

>Ronald McDonald was also opposed in India and his image was temporarily banned. The protests were triggered by a 2001 publication that McDonald's was frying its fries with beef tallow. Hundreds of angry Hindus then stormed McDonald's outlets in Mumbai and set them on fire. Statues and posters with Ronald's portrait on them were smeared with cow dung and/or scratched beyond recognition.[1]

>In 2011, the organization Corporate Accountability International demanded that McDonald's immediately remove Ronald as an official advertising figure. The reason for this was the rapidly increasing obesity among children and young people, for which fast food companies, including McDonald's, were (and are) held responsible. McDonald's rejected the claims with reference to Ronald's popularity and his success in the charitable sector. However, the advertising concept has been changed: Ronald does sports and gymnastics in recent commercials, calling on children to get fit.[12]

This goes back to 1948 when under the influence of the Greek Civil War, the Cyprus Football Association decided to expel or communist-leaning football players and express its support for the nationalist side of the civil war. The expelled players created their own teams and their own league and operated in parallel for several years before merging back into the CFA. The league may be unified, but the society remains divided. Then ultras take it to extremes: communist ultras call the police horrible names and go to bookclubs to study Marxist theory, nationalist ultras break into migrant NGO offices and beat up employees.

Polish public healthcare system is one of the worst in whole EU, but the mental health system is even worse. Public mental health system in Poland is literally shit and you can't really count on any serious or immediate help. It's better to try private mental health system right away, but it's often pricey. I went to private psychiatrist and took some drugs, but unfortunately I didn't have enough to afford private psychotherapy.

>Bonus question: How prevalent is mental illness stigma in your country?

Very prevalent. It's 21st century but still if someone is mentally ill they are often treated with less respect or are seen as weirdos. When it comes to depression, if you're a woman, people can understand this, but if you're a man (just like me), you're being told to ""man up"" or that you're a pussy or a crybaby, and you're being ridiculed. Many people still believe that depression doesn't exist. The issue of male depression is still pathetic here in Poland and not many guys decide to seek help because they are afraid of being ridiculed for that. And unfortunately way more men than women try to commit suicides and they are successful. Because of all that I decided to seek help very late, after I developed a severe depression and suffered from suicidal thoughts.",24

Almost always, the old city centers of Dutch cities will be *above* sea level, in places where sand carried by rivers naturally settles, usually along river bends or where two rivers combine. Back when the water was unmanaged and ruled by the tides, those where the only liveable places. There is in fact a marker in Amsterdam's city hall; sea level is in the basement. ([See the photos on the Dutch Wikipedia page](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normaal_Amsterdams_Peil)).

On a related note, simple flood defences have been around for a very long time. Usually, it started with building a dam at the mouth of a minor river, and only opening the dam at low tide to let the water out. That way, flooding is much less likely. That's how many Dutch places got their name: the Dam in the river Amstel, the river Rotte, the river Zaan, etc.

Finally, note that the Dutch definition of sea level is traditionally ""average *high* tide in Amsterdam"", so even without defenses, not all land would be permanently flooded.

Kazik titled the song ""My grief is better than yours"" and it was generally targeting politicians who seem to have more privileges than regular people.

The scandal, though, only emerged when song hit number 1 spot on cult state Radio 3 chart. The chart for that day was later cancelled and internet votes disappeared from their web page. This led to several journalist leaving radio in the protests, PiS politicians denying any form of censorship and blaming it on overzealous workers and/or manipulation during the vote count.   


In typical Streisand effect, song grew enormously and currently sits on 17 million views on youtube. Song itself is kind of meh but fit into long, long tradition of rockmen contesting those in power.

When I was in primary school my parents sometimes took me out of school for a week during the winter time to go skiing or the last few days of the school year (in June) if we had some special trip planned. This did not happen in secondary school though, as the workload was considerable and I could not really afford missing classes in this way.

I don't have any children of my own but I'm a kindergarten teacher too and I noticed that an alarming number of children are downright addicted to having some sort of electronic thing in their hands. They completely disregard any ""usual"" toys and have close to no interest in outdoor play anymore.

We do have tablets - which we're supposed to be using for a book reading app (Polyglutt) and two games that I believe are actually fun and helpful (BlaBlaBox and Osmo) since they use a lot of numbers and letter/word building, but kids always find their way to restoring Youtube and watching videos, opening random apps, setting an alarm, or taking way too many pictures... We're really trying to limit the time the kids spend with these things (sometimes we actually end up taking the whole thing away since they start fighting and arguing for ""who holds the tablet and who decides what book to listen to""), but then it's unfair towards those kids that actually want to use it for like 15 minutes then do something else.

Personally once I do get my own kids, I'd do like my parents did. If we're watching something during daytime, kid is welcome to watch (though it's probably gonna be boring so it won't take long until they give up and look for something else to do lol).

The Pros and Cons are different for England and Scotland. 

Pros (both):

* good access to tech jobs, though salaries can be sub-par for anything outside London+Oxford+Cambridge
* English as the local language makes it easy to start integrating

Cons (both):

* The Brits tend to have their social groups more-less set in stone.  It's well possible to make friends, but those remain singular connections (i.e. you'll almost never have them introduce you to *their* friends)
* Indirect communication culture - I'm used to it by now, and actually find the directness I find in Poland kinda harsh, but people never explicitly saying what they think it can be a barrier to communicating effectively sometimes
* Brexit and general rise of right-wing nationalism
* Low socio-economic mobility (people who have more social and financial capital have super disproportionately easier time getting even more ahead)

Pros (Scotland):

* **Amazing** access to nature (though not as forested as I'd like it) + delicious and clean tap water
* More affordable than England
* People are way more inclined to be casually social (i.e. chatting in the bus stop, in the park etc.)
* I felt incomparably more welcome as a foreigner (it sometimes feels like there is a bit of a ""come and be Scottish with us"" kind of narrative)

Cons (Scotland):

* Nearly all the nature has had it forest removed centuries ago and is now pretty barren
* The weather on the west coast is absolute and utter sheit",42

Problems me and my colleagues notice:

Students are depressed, stressed and just generally dealing badly with the circumstances as they are. Dropout rate is higher with people who ""just can't cope"". It is concerning to say the least.

Students are less motivated and engage less in class; the online format doesn't measure up at all to a classroom setting. It's not suitable for the best in-depth discussions. Group work is also harder to make 'fun' but we encourage it anyway for another moment of social contact.

Finally, the language, spelling and style in assignments has been atrocious. Really subpar. This was a problem prior to the pandemic as well but this year it's nearing completely unacceptable levels. Ultimately I think the pandemic has made this much worse as this generation of students has now basically lost out on 1 entire year of ""real"" school/language classes (by no means discrediting the incredible efforts of high school teachers here!!! They must make do with what they are given). Super important freshman classes on essay writing have also all been online so they too have probably been less effective...it shows.

 - Then the main dish, it could be a paella, it could be a BBQ, a pizza, etc.

Weddings for example are a little different. You'd usually hold the banquet in a big place specialised in this kind of events and, like a boss battle, it has two phases.

 - A main dish, usually with a quick time event where the waiter makes you choose between meat and fish.
 - Dessert: sometimes there's some dessert previous to the wedding cake, sometimes it's the wedding cake directly.
 - Coffee. You'll need it because the dance and Paquito el Chocolatero are coming. Pouring some alcohol in the coffee to help you handle dancing with 197 different people is recommended.",91

Like, I can and do call friends of any gender ""honey"" (as in ""oh honey 😔"") or ""my love"". Other women might say ""darling"", ""sweetie"", or even ""babe"" (which I personally consider quite intimate). We could say all these things to small children, and nobody would bat an eyelid. But God forbid that a man say any of that to anyone besides their partner and their children. It would be a strong sign of effeminacy (which is not a bad thing), if it weren't perceived as just creepy. Things like ""love"" and ""sweetheart"" are kinda unisex, but possibly condescending when said by a man to a woman (and a man wouldn't ordinarily say those to another man). It doesn't really go the other way. I perceive certain terms of endearment to be tinged masculine, but that's really just a me thing and I wouldn't expect anyone to agree with me.

I think these protections are often a good thing because it helps the consumer know what they are buying. And it helps small makers selling their products, even if you always have the industrial version.

I expect a *reblochon* from a small cheese maker to be good quality. An industrial *reblochon* bought in supermarket will still be good because they followed the rules to make it, even if they'll do what they can to reduce the costs. A *fromage à tartiflette* is a knock off made by industrial so that they can make a cheap cheese that still looks like *reblochon* without having to follow the specifications (and really, it's savorless).

Bad side of the protection :

* when it's very restricted geographically, you can end up with situations like Roquefort. The whole village is progressively being taken over by Lactalis, a huge industrial.

* the specifications means that sometimes a product will no be given the name, even if it's great. In the worst cases that can mean throwing away part of the production if it's not up to standards. I went to a cheese seller who always sold some of these ""bad"" cheese, ""bad"" meaning ""this *Beaufort* tastes awesome, but it had a few holes in it so we can't call it *Beaufort* and it's half the price"".

There is a sauna in pretty much every detached or terraced house, and most apartment buildings typically have a shared sauna that can be reserved for an hour at a time, or sometimes separate saunas in each apartment. It's estimated that there are between 2 and 3.2 million saunas in Finland, so roughly one sauna for every two people. Public saunas are somewhat popular too, but most of the time people go to the sauna either by themselves or with their family or friends. Men and women go to the sauna at the same time, and usually naked if they know each other even remotely or if going with strangers of the same sex, but it's not considered rude if someone prefers to wear their swimsuit.

I've never heard of anyone drinking tea in sauna. Alcohol is common. When by ourselves or with the family, some people drink a ""sauna beer"" or two, but many don't. It's quite common to have *saunailta*s (lit. sauna evenings) with friends, during which we drink alcohol before, during and after the sauna, and do it for hours and hours, going outside to cool down every once in a while before heading back to the sauna with a new drink.

- Sabes más/eres más listo que los ratones coloraos (you know more/are smarter than the red haired mice). Some say this comes from countryside mice allegedly being smarter than city mice, others talk about some folcloric goblins that took the shape of red haired mice.

- Sabes más/eres más listo que Cardona (you know more/are smarter than Cardona). This is supposed to come from the Viscount of Cardona who, during the XIV century, was able to foresee that Kind Pedro el Ceremonioso was going to kill and managed to escape before this happened.

There's something curious in Spanish with foxes. If you say someone is a fox (es un zorro, está hecho UN zorro), people will likely understand that he's intelligent, specially in a ""cunning"" sense. I don't think it's a traditional expression, but I think it's a perfectly valid metaphor since foxes are considered the paradigm of sly, crafty, etc. However, if you say someone or something looks like ""some foxes"" (está hecho UNOS zorros), this means it's unkempt, scruffy or untidy.",25

m6omje,religious discrepancies in the baltics?,23,"according to wikipedia, nearly 65% of estonians are irreligious, while neighboring latvia and nearby lithuania are only about 18% and 6% irreligious respectively. what is the cause of this difference?",27,2021-03-17 01:19:19,2021-05-13 23:27:45.999097,57 days 22:08:26.999107,1,"Lithuania has a very different history and is historically catholic. After all, they are next to Poland and I think you are aware what is going on there atm.

Estonia and (northern) Latvia share a lot of history. Both are historically protestant (Lutheran) countries (this was kinda set to stone under Swedish rule). Both countries also are and have been falling out of religion, fast.

The difference between Estonia and Latvia comes down to minority nations. As most Estonians are irreligious, the ones that are religious are to a large degree Russians and Ukrainians living here. This is similar to any case of minority nation - the different religion (orthodox) has became not only a religion in itself, but also a part of Russian identity compared to Estonians. And it is the same in Latvia, the difference being, that Latvia has proportionally a bit more of Russians and Ukrainians living there than Estonia does. Therefore their number is a bit higher. I'm not sure, where the rest of the difference comes from, but they do have a greater variety of different churches, there is even an Anglican church in Riga. 

Now, as some people foolishly claim that Estonia (or any country, really) is the most atheist country or similar, then keep in mind, that most of these studies (all the big ones in our case) have clumped atheists and agnostics into one category as ""irreligious"", but obviously, there is quite a big difference. In addition to this, as this is self-reported, it does come down to what people themselves think about their beliefs - and unfortunately the knowledge about religion etc is very low, as it was basically banned during USSR. This means, that the same people, who claim to be atheist, also say that they believe there is life after death or they believe there is a higher power or they buy healing crystals, or they are essencially animistic etc. Or, on the other hand, people that claim to be Christians also say that they don't believe that Christ rose from death. I mean... ain't this like the main point of Christianity? But yes, as far as organized religion goes, these countries don't really do it anymore. Going  to church every Sunday is basically unheard of. Though I am really interested to see the new results of our national census at the end of this year - I've noticed quite some kids joining baptist or methodist churches, and I'm not sure if this is a sign of the new generation not being so distant from religion or if these are just the same kids that would've been Lutherans were they 10 years older.",30

Electricity delivery prices rose by over 50% very quickly for much of Finland, the company used and probably still uses tax havens and loopholes and paid only under 2% tax on their massive profit (50 million profit, 800 000 tax paid) while they claimed they were losing money.

m5v2q2,where do people from your country’s diaspora live in europe?,65,"i’m half italian and half somali.somali diapora communities in europe are mainly based in the north sea area. these include: britain , sweden , norway , the netherlands , germany , denmark  and finland . communities exist in other countries but are lower than 10,000. many somalis in these countries have family in other european countries. somali-europeans migrating between countries is common too, although most somali-european migration happens into the uk, for example around 20,000 of the somalis in britain are dutch-born.areas like camden, harlesden, southall, northolt, greenford, acton, leyton, walthamstow, tottenham, tower hamlets, manor park, hayes and many more areas of london have thousands of somalis each.italian diaspora: according to wikipedia, the countries in europe with the highest amount of people with italian ancestry outside of italy  include france , germany , belgium , britain , spain  and surprising russia . 10,000-30,000 italians also live in the following countries: austria, luxembourg, croatia, albania, portugal and poland.as for england, the strongest self-contained italian communities are ones of southern-origin who have been here for generations.these include: clerkenwell: : often known as london’s little italy, which has been home to italians since 1850’s, with the community being centred around the ‘st peter’s italian church’ which does services in italian. during migrations from southern italy in the 40’s and 50’s the area was re-populated by new waves of italians, with the area becoming a focal point for new italian migrants nowadays . i couldn’t find out how many italians live here and in neighbouring areas  but as a resident i’d guess several thousands of italians live in clerkenwell and nearby neighbourhoods.bedford: a large town in england which is home to 14,000 italians  out of a population of 100,000. this is mainly as a result of labour recruitment in the early 1950s by the london brick company from southern italy . the town made local news for ‘disorder’ after italy knocked out england in the 2012 euros on penalties.peterborough: a large town in england which is home to around 7,000 italians. this is also mainly as a result of labour recruitment in the early 1950s by the london brick company from southern italy .woking: a medium sized town in england which is home to around 3,000 italians. the majority of the original arrivals  came to work in the britax factory in byfleet and on the mushroom farms in chobham . i’ve noticed a lot of the community has moved into guildford  near woking is also worth noting, last time i visited guildford i saw a handful of italian businesses . i tried to see how many italians are located in guildford, but all i found was how many italian-born italians live in surrey  and apparently it’s 4,000, which is interesting as only 700 of woking’s 3,000 italians were born in italy. if i had to guess guildford has a large number of italians too, possibly more than woking nowadays. this makes sense because 1. woking is essentially a massive suburb of guildford and 2. the only town larger than woking in surrey is guildford - the economic opportunity for woking britalians to move here and set up new italian businesses and look for work makes a lot of sense, and newer italians moving here also makes sense due to a strong italian community existing in nearby woking .what’s it like for your country and it’s diaspora? also feel free to answer if you’re part of a non-european ethnicity/nationality which has diaspora communities inside europe.",23,2021-03-15 21:14:58,2021-05-13 23:28:07.956356,59 days 02:13:09.956362,1,"If there's an English diaspora at all, it's probably in Spain (mostly embarrassing people, sorry) and parts of rural France (slightly less embarrassing people but sorry for the bad French, including myself when I lived there).

At the hairdresser's there is usually also something, although I only give something if employees have done my hair, about 1-2 euros, if the boss does my hair (usually), of course he doesn't get a tip.

m2p1sj,how accessible are healthcare treatments in your country?,46,"i'm from the netherlands and i usually see posts on this subreddit that ranks the netherlands pretty high up for healthcare quality but to be honest from my own experience and from stories i have heard from friends/family i would not agree that our healthcare system is as great as these graphs make it out to be. i am curious to hear about your experiences with healthcare in your country.i have noticed that if you want to get tests done or get access to certain treatments here, you have to have done the research yourself, and a lot of the times you have to really push the doctor to get something more than just being sent home with the recommendation to take some paracetamol.when i was 10 i started having aural migraines and when i went to the doctor several times for this they would just tell me that i was just imagining it. it was not until i was 20 that i actually learned what an aura is and that it also increases the risk of stroke. i had to read this off the internet and no doctor has ever told me this. when i discussed this with my doctor they acknowledged this as if it was common knowledge. i thought that maybe i just didn't have a good doctor, but i have had at least 3 different doctors now and there is no difference in the way they handle these things.recently i got into an accident and developed deep vein thrombosis. at first the doctor didn't believe i could have a blood clot because of my age  despite my leg being blue and really painful and swollen. i had to really push to get an appointment with the gp. they referred me then to the er room where it was diagnosed. after three months of blood thinners, the clot was mostly gone except for a portion that is not going away on its own which still hurts a lot. after discussing possible treatments, the only two things that were recommended were fitness and perhaps surgery in a year. however, it was clear that the doctor was pretty against this surgery as he kept saying how expensive and difficult it would be and that fitness should help a bit. i talked to someone who is an er doctor in the us and they proposed different treatment options, which after researching i discovered were clearly available in the netherlands. i talked to my doctor about this and he first said he didn't know if it was possible but that he would ask around. now he explained that this treatment is only possible in the first 3 weeks after the development of the blood clot and now it's clearly too late. i asked if there was anything else they could do but he said that they don't want to do anything until in a year to see if the body does anything to fix itself.in addition to my own experiences, i have heard a lot of similar stories from friends and family members where conditions were discovered too late because doctors refused to do tests or just sent people home with paracetamol. a coworker's wife, as well as a friend's father both, had cancer that was discovered way too late, despite having symptoms years earlier. i know that cancer can't always be discovered early and that hindsight is 20/20, but i feel that the reluctance to do tests here is very worrisome. when my grandma was 92 years old and had a lot of abdominal pains the doctor asked her if she had her period recently as a possible reason for the pain  at 92 years old.i have become very wary of the dutch healthcare system, i don't feel like i'm taken seriously by a lot of doctors and have seriously been looking at information about the healthcare system in other european countries. the thing is that stories from people give a way better idea of how everything is organized than those maps that are posted.how have you experienced the healthcare system in your country? do you feel like doctors take you seriously, do they inform you of all of your options, and do they give you access to treatments if needed?",30,2021-03-11 12:30:47,2021-05-13 23:29:33.909863,63 days 10:58:46.909869,1,"There's controversy in Spain around our public Health system regarding the excessive amount of time one would need to wait in order to get his treatment, the laboral situation of healthcare workers, and the privatisation of the system, among other topics that are frequently debated. 

Honestly, I don't have enough information to form my own solid opinion about these issues, so I can't really give my insight on the general situation.

Talking exclusively about my personal experience, in the recent past (about 5 years ago) I was feeling really bad. It hurt a lot and I felt very dizzy, so I went to the hospital. I don't remember much because at that moment I was about to pass out but I remember I was seen by a doctor almost immediately, they set me up for intervention and that same day that felt like years I was operated. I recovered fine and left after a few weeks.

A couple years ago my mother was seriously ill. I was called when she was already under treatment at the hospital so I don't know how the diagnosis procedure went, but she recovered fine.

My only bad experience was with my father. He was diagnosed with cancer way too late and he couldn't make it. However I don't think any doctor was to blame there. At the time he was first seen at the hospital, nothing could be done.

So all in all my experience has been very positive. I am aware that a lot of people might've had negative experiences, and there are probably a lot of things to improve. However, talking only and exclusively about my personal experience, I feel very grateful to our healthcare system and every healthcare worker.

What is the purpose of trying to draw districts? There's no one right or wrong answer, but the outcomes will impact people no matter what.

The only firm requirement is each US House district (or whatever legislative body you are drawing districts for) has roughly the same number of people in it.

But what is the goal in drawing districts?

Is it just to create districts of equal population, ignoring all demographics, local and county borders, neighborhoods, communities of interest, and so on? That's really easy to do.

Is it to create as many competitive districts as possible? Eh, a bit more of a challenge, and it usually comes at the cost of splitting up urban areas into several districts. So a city like Indianapolis, located in the middle of the state which is currently in two Congressional districts, would probably need to be split into three or four districts. Does someone living in downtown Indianapolis have much in common with someone living in rural Rush County (pop 17.5k)? Eh probably not, but to create competitive districts in areas with a lot of rural land, blue cities like Indianapolis, Cleveland, or St Louis would need to be split into several districts.

Is it to generally try to respect current municipal and county borders when possible? Easy to do, but you'll probably end up with a bunch of heavy blue districts and heavy R districts.

Is it to create districts that are more likely to elect a woman or a person of color? [Illinois' 4th Congressional Districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s_4th_congressional_district) is a majority Hispanic district but only does so by looping in several  Hispanic neighborhoods in a....quite odd fashion. While this is possible, in less dense areas it would likely lead to packing liberal leaning votes into a few districts and make the surrounding rural areas heavily Republican and possibly diluting Democratic votes .

TLDR: This shit is complicated and I don't think just computers drawing algorithms will be able to solve it.",30

Historically, we inhabited the areas north of the Great Lakes. In ancient history, we were mostly nomadic with certain places we would stop at that would create splinter groups and political/cultural centers of the Ojibwe. Our creation myth is based on these “stopping points”. I’m not the most spiritual guy, but the general idea is there were 7 miigis who each represented a different teaching. 6 stayed to teach and established doodems (clans) and 1 returned to sea. The seventh is the Thunderbird, and it was too powerful for the people. It’s spiritual power killed the people in the Waabanakiing. These doodems were established to teach the miide way of life.

As far as what most people know of Native American tribes, we were pretty technologically advanced having developed rudimentary metallurgy by the time of European contact. We mined copper and iron. We also have written language, stories passed on scrolls of birch bark. We had some of the biggest canoes, too, also made of birch. We also developed a farming system that was based on the cultivation of wild rice and maple syrup.

Our dwellings are known as wigwams. They are basically a tent made of wood and hard packed mud or leather. Not your typical teepee style, but like a geodesic dome. 

Our trade routes were large and spanned much of the country. There is written and oral history of contact with almost all the Algonquin-language derivative tribes at some point, who all had contact with some of the southern and western tribes, who had trade routes down to the Azteca. Indirectly, they were aware of the existence of Central American civilizations but never truly contacted them directly or held direct trade routes.

At the time of colonization, our tribe was part of the Iron Confederacy, a military alliance between the Ojibwe, Assiniboine, and Métis. We were a direct enemy of the Iroquois Confederacy. We are also a member tribe of the Council of Three Fires.

We had a pretty positive relationship with the settlers due to our relatively advanced trade routes and goods available. We became well armed and powerful through French traders. Of course, we suffered the same fate that all Native Americans did and lost our tribal homes during the westward expansion and suffered acts of genocide from the Canadian and United States Governments. 

Today we live in section 8 housing (really shitty condo blocks), farm houses, and normal suburban homes. Something like 70% of Turtle Mountain Chippewa are catholic.

For many if not most kids, soccer is the first sport they’ll play because for parents it’s a very low risk sport from both a financial and injury risk perspective, especially as baseball is somewhat waning in popularity. Basketball for kids that young can almost be detrimental to their game as they can build up bad habits not being strong enough to shoot. As kids get older, they gravitate more towards other, more popular sports. Some stick with soccer, but many switch over. Up until extremely recently, unless your parents were immigrants or you are a real exception, no American kids grew up watching a soccer game with their parents. They watched football, basketball, etc. and likely went to some professional or games in person. Their parents could teach them the ins and outs. There were constant clips on sportscenter and live games to watch. This wasn’t the case with soccer. Now that the first generation of kids who had soccer moms has grown up and started to have kids of their own and soccer is easily accessible on tv, it’ll be interesting to see what happens to the sports popularity. It certainly won’t replace football or basketball, but in a lot of the country I’d be surprised if it doesn’t overtake hockey (I say this as a big hockey fan as well)",37

The first is that there's definitely a social pressure to integrate when at school. It's fairly rare that education is available in a language other than English so the children of immigrants tend to have social pressure to integrate even if their parents do not.

Another aspect is that becoming American is not just about being born in the USA. People can become citizens and have the rights of any other citizen (other than rare cases like becoming president). There's a test and interviews to show that they support and have a basic understanding of American government as well. As a result, no one can ever say someone is not a citizen just because of what they look like. 

And third, though it's possibly becoming less influential, is [American civil religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_religion). Basically the concept that all Americans have basic tenets that they agree on, such as the importance of the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and voting for representation. Or that Americans have special reverence for the flag or American institutions like the 4th of July or even things like baseball or football.

I hope integration stays easy for immigrants because I think that integration and cultural fusion is one of the best parts of America.",94

h0kj63,why do people fly the confederate flag?,499,so today nascar banned the confederate flag and i got to thinking. why is it flown. like they lost the war and they’re super proud of it. might as well just fly a big l instead. just confused on why people are so proud over a loss.,742,2020-06-10 21:20:24,2021-05-14 15:55:04.122556,337 days 18:34:40.122560,0,"I can provide a little insight as a Southerner who's seen this a lot if you're actually interested, OP, and aren't just looking for snarky comments.

So this is kind of an uncomfortable one because there are some significant disparities between what a symbol objectively stands for (or stood for) and the way in which people actually use/understand the symbol today. To make things even more annoying, there's a lot of overlap between the two as well.

Yes, the Confederate battle flag was, and really still *is*, a symbol of an oppressive rebellion that was fighting for the right to continue enslaving people and white supremacy, not to mention quite literally a treasonous cause, *however* (and this is where things get dicey), it means different things to different people and if you actually care about the issue, then that's important to take into consideration just for the sake of your argument/voice remaining valid.

I reside in Tennessee for the majority of my year and I can say without a doubt that some people who fly the ""stars and bars"" are certainly racist. They think the South should have won the Civil War, they are all for revisionist history, and they often refer to the conflict (sometimes tongue in cheek, sometimes not) as ""The War of Northern Aggression."" These people exist. There is absolutely no denying that.

However, there are plenty of other people who don't view it that way, but rather as a symbol of Southern Heritage -- that's not to say it makes it okay, but you automatically lose credibility as soon as you try saying that all people who fly it are explicitly racist/side with the Confederacy. You can blame Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Dukes of Hazard or a whole host of other popular media, combined with ignorance, for people associating it with Southern culture, but the fact remains that it's real.

To give you an idea, a poll run in 2015 showed that [fifty-seven percent of Americans viewed the Confederate battle flag as a symbol of ""Southern Pride.""](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/public-opinion-confederate-flag-and-civil-war) You don't have to agree with these people, I don't, but it's important to also not act is if they don't exist. The more troubling part is that while respondents may say they view it as ""Southern Pride,"" it doesn't mean that they don't also hold racist, pro-Confederacy views as the two are clearly not mutually exclusive. When you look at former Conderate states more specifically, the [opinions tend to be about close to equal to each other](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/01/13/what-confederate-flag-means-america-today) when respondents were given the choice between ""Southern Pride"" and ""Racism.""

For example, I attended college in Tennessee and I have seen, on more than one occasion, a black American student driving a truck with the flag attached to the bed, which is the first contradiction, but then also flying an American flag on the opposite side of the bed, leaving us with a second contradiction. In one case, because I've actually spoken to him before, he was a member of Alpha Gamma Rho (AGR). For those of you unfamiliar with it, it's an agricultural fraternity and he fit the rest of the bill pretty well (dipped, severely curved baseball cap, work/cowboy boots, etc.) To him, it clearly didn't stand for the traditional meaning of the symbol. Similarly, he didn't see it as a symbol for treason, like one would normally expect, and saw no contradiction flying it next to the American flag -- and he's not alone.

So, does that make it okay? I'd say no.

However, it does matter when actually discussing the issue of the flag. If you're being intellectually honest, you have got to see that both: 1) The flag is a symbol of hate, division, and a plethora of other negative things, but also 2) Many people flying the flag don't intend it that way and that a lot of people don't view it in that light.

I don't really know what the perfect solution is, and I don't claim to, but what needs to happen is there needs to be a new symbol for Southern pride that doesn't have such terrible history. I don't agree that the Confederate battle flag should stay present as a ""Southern heritage"" symbol because, quite frankly, that's not what it is. Some have tried to switch to the Gadsden flag, but that's not exactly ""Southern"" and really doesn't fit.

I view it as being something similar to a Swastika or any other symbol from a genocidal group. The weird part is that unlike the fallout after Nazi Germany came to an end, people didn't immediately stop using Confederacy iconography (though maybe that actually was the case in post-war Germany as well, I'm not a massive history buff so that may have still taken some time).

I know that doesn't help with the issue itself, but from a Southern American perspective, hopefully it helps you to at least understand what is going on in their minds when they fly it.

If someone has a French name, you may assume they're from Louisiana or one of the northern states that border Quebec. If someone has a Scandinavian name, you may assume they're from somewhere in the midwest like Minnesota or North Dakota.

This isn't a foolproof method because obviously you can be of Italian descent and live in Mississippi or be of Norwegian descent and live in Florida, but it works sometimes. When people immigrated here most ethnic groups stuck to a particular region because that's where many of their countrymen went to.

* Start with what you want to study, look into schools that have good programs for that course of study and a good reputation in that field

* Once you've established what the best schools are, look at what you can reasonably get into and expect to do well in

* Research prospective schools intensely, each school will have their own requirements, culture and lifestyle that will be unique and potentially totally unlike others

* Do plenty of research, there's often a lot under the surface that will have big ramifications later, often the best resource are the schools themselves, who will be happy to walk you through the selection process and highlight the attributes of their school

* Do not rely on ""knowledge"" from media and cultural references, real life is very different

* Find schools with culture and programs that interest you and that will give you the best chance to succeed

A felony will also really ruin your life, you'll be lucky if you can get a job pushing a mop or find someone to rent you an apartment; you cannot bear arms and ~~often~~ sometimes cannot vote. Misdemeanors aren't nearly so bad, although you may be barred from entering Canada and can forget about a commercial driver's license with a drunk driving conviction and you can forget about a job in banking or insurance if you've been convicted of anything involving stealing.

Sometimes even minor things that are normally misdemeanors like shoplifting or drunk driving can get elevated to felonies if you get too many in a certain amount of time, the theory being that you obviously aren't getting the message that you don't steal or drive drunk.

Example state misdemeanors:

* Traffic offenses (Edit: My state Minnesota considers most moving violations as petty misdemeanors with only things like parking tickets as not technically crimes but rather infractions. It seems this is not the norm)
* Personal use quantities of weed in states where it is not legal on the state level
* Domestic and Bar Fight type batteries, where punches are thrown but no one is seriously hurt
* Drunk Driving
* Minor theft and shoplifting (generally under a few hundred dollars)
* Drunk In Public / Disorderly Conduct / Open Container (generally used to get people off the street when they're causing a ruckus and nothing more specific fits)
* Under 21 possessing alcohol.

State Felonies:

* Possessing hard drugs, selling any drugs
* Grand theft
* Robbery
* Generally any crime where a weapon is involved is a felony and using a weapon makes other felonies a whole lot worse. A lot of burglars in Florida had found out the hard way that suddenly they're ""armed burglars"" if they steal a gun along with a TV set.
* Murder / Manslaughter
* Burglary / Home Invasion,

Federal Felonies:

* What would otherwise be a state felony that crosses state lines
* Drug trafficking
* Counterfeiting
* Anything involving the US Mail
* Crimes against elected federal officials
* Terrorism, Skyjacking",45
mlk2l4,immigrants in america: do you like living there?,499,i’m from europe considering moving. do you like it there?,611,2021-04-06 19:48:23,2021-05-14 15:57:06.247341,37 days 20:08:43.247344,0,"My partners family is French, including my partner who is a dual citizen. He moved at a young age, but was educated at a private French school until his teenage years. They LOVE to talk about all the things that are better in France, all about weird cultural quirks of Americans that range from charming to unhealthy. I wouldn’t call them arrogant actually, but I do understand some aspects of why they’re perceived that way. It seems like they don’t like living here based on how they talk...

But ~20 years later, visiting France regularly (minus covid) they still haven’t moved back and are almost finished renovating what the house they plan to retire in.....in the United States. Fact of the matter is, for the kind of job his dad has, the pay is better here, the taxes are lower even in “high tax” states. It was difficult initially but at this point they can find community that they enjoy, they can retain their language without much discrimination, and they’re satisfied with the quality of life they have here. (They’re also incredibly privileged so obviously this doesn’t apply to everyone)

They are annoyed by the food culture here and don’t seem to ever have gotten really used to it and as a result have a ton of extra yogurt makers that they share! They are still very protective of their culture and food and inside their home it’s still pretty French even after ~20 years. On the flip side they also have a lot of anxiety about preserving the language and general “French ness” within the family. His mom likes me but I’m a monolingual American she (loudly, often) worries a lot about whether we’ll force her non-existent grandchildren to speak French at home..

So yeah that’s my 2 cents. Oh and I would LOVE to move to France after we finish grad school but my partner has no interest. His older brother worked and lived in Paris for years but he says that the pay will be better in America so we should stay here...*sigh* so yeah it seems like they like it here!",10

Discriminatory *sourcing*, on the other hand, is generally fair game. Suppose you wanted to increase black representation in your company.

My first thought is that it seems absolutely absurd for an individual city to implement reparations.  However, upon actually seeing the resolution, I don't think it calls for what people typically think of as reparations.  What it actually does is:

1) Acknowledge and apologize for the city's role in historically racist practices, including slavery.

2) Form a committee to report on areas where racial disparities may exist and empower them to recommend policies to help racial minorities. 

The first point is more of a symbolic one and I'm not bothered by the city taking a side against slavery and systemic racism.  The second point doesn't sound too radical to me and I'd find it hard to believe if there aren't plenty of other cities already doing something similar.  It just seems to me that the use of the word ""reparations"" makes this seem more unique, exciting, and controversial than it actually is.",25

* Older streetcar suburbs - generally denser and might have a ""high street"" filled with densely packed buildings containing shops and restaurants. Look into Kenmore, NY
* Historic suburban communities - These are areas settled before the automobile and therefore are often denser.

k4cric,"as promised, my praise of gary, indiana",83,"my fellow americans and upright foreigners, i come to you today not to badmouth gary, indiana as per the tradition of the hoosier state. nay, today i am here to sing the praises of gary!one might say that not since “the music man” has gary been a place heaped with grand praise. truly, life in gary has been hard for more than fifty years. but a hard present doesn’t invalidate a respectable past. indeed, in the days of yore gary was second only to pittsburg as a source of steel in america. in fact, the russian city of magnitogorsk renovated inself in the 1930s to fill the same role for the ussr. it literally used gary as a model.after ww2 gary thrived. it’s mills were a place where a blue collar worker could earn enough for them to have their own home and a comfortable life. indeed, gary in those days was the model of the american dream! “the music man” did not choose just any town to exemplify the idea of a delightful american town. it chose a place that, at the time, embodied that idea.but no golden age lasts forever. and it is true the last several decades have been hard for gary. however, we americans are a resilient people. and so are our cities resilient. gary has started to pull itself up in recent years. many abandoned buildings are being torn down to make way for possibilities. while others are being repurposed. such as this old church that’s being turned into a garden.to bring in new residents the city has launched a $1 home program that has proven successful.modern times have been hard for many of us and for many places. gary has had it hard longer and worse than most places. and yet, while its fire might have dimmed, now the ember strengthens. hope grows and like the phoenix gary may rise anew, strong and glorious. yes, my friends, do not look to gary and as an example of what can go wrong in america. look and see the truth that gary is an example of how america never gives up and will eventually find a way to pull itself up again after even the most dire of setbacks.gary, for the bottom of my heart, i salute you!",335,2020-12-01 03:37:23,2021-05-14 16:00:23.209729,164 days 12:23:00.209736,0,Chevrolet's marketing department would like to know your location.,382

But not all classes are equal, and so some schools assign a bonus to some classes (sometimes for only some purposes, like determining valedictorian). So whereas a ""normal class might be 0-4, a particularly difficult class might be 1-5 instead. That way a student who gets straight A's in hard classes will be ahead of a student who gets straight A's in easier classes. In unweighted GPA, straight A's is always 4.0 regardless of class difficulty.

(There's another possible meaning for weighted versus unweighted GPA, but it tends to pertain more to university, where classes can be worth different amounts of credits -- in that context weighted GPA takes the credits of each class into account, so if you have A's in two 3-credit courses and C's in six 1-credit courses, you'd have a B-average of 3.0.)

AP is Advanced Placement. They are more difficult classes (so in the context of GPA, they're likely to get an extra point in GPA). Near the end of the year, students in AP classes can take the AP exam corresponding to that class, and many universities give course credit for a sufficient score on AP exams.

Extracurriculars are anything that's school-related but not a class. So that includes sports, non-sport competitive teams (debate team, quiz bowl), theater productions, sometimes marching band (it can sometimes be in an odd situation where it's a class and an extracurricular too due to the extra time commitment), clubs, etc. Extracurriculars are not mandatory. Many students choose fun activities, although students are also sometime pushed to take up activities that are perceived to be beneficial for university admissions.",114

>A year after Mount Holyoke’s grading system was put into place, they changed each letter so they represented different percentages. According to todayifoundout.com, “B became anything from 90-94%, C was 85-89%, D was 80-84%, and E was 75-79%. Below that, they added in the dreaded F.”

Well the most obvious, stereotypical feature is epenthesis. 

Epenthesis is when you add additional sounds into a word. Everyone does this. In English, we occasionally say ham**p**ster instead of hamster. Warm**p**th and draw**r**ing are two additional examples. In Italian, per**ts**ona is occasionally heard instead of persona. 

In this context, though, I’m specifically referring to *It’s-uh me, Mario.* Italians don’t like words that don’t end in vowels so when speaking English you tend to insert them. It’s a stereotype. 

*You-uh real-uh fuck ‘em up!* is another one. I hear that one a lot. 

---

Anyway, some other things I’ve noticed with my mother are:

- Complete failure to use r-colored vowels. It’s a weird sound, don’t beat yourself up if you can’t do it. American English and certain Chinese languages are, more or less, the only language to have this sound. A couple of dialects here and there. Canadian French, for example, likely through English influence. Technically, it’s a vowel. 

- She loses her Hs, because they’re silent in Italian. But sometimes they get inserted in words that don’t have Hs. 

- Using /i/ instead of /ɪ/. That is, ~~h**i**d vs h**i**de.~~ (Edit: I’m dumb.) Or live/leave. Bitch and beach. Sheet/shit. That latter two being comical. 

- Italian subjunctive is thriving, English subjunctive is moribund. Sometimes you’ll hear perfectly grammatically correct constructions that sound weird because we really don’t talk like that. 

There are probably more, but I’m drawring [sic] a blank right now. 

>Has anyone been able to get the American accent 

Well my mom has been here for decades, and I know a lot of Italian emigres, and, well... good luck. You could do it, but good luck. When did you start learning English, I think that’s the key. 

I wouldn’t fret too much. If it really bothers you take a class. But I’m sure you’re fine. Non ti preoccupare.",73

I do think many Canadians (and small-country Europeans) on Reddit especially, are envious of what the US has and as a result, a superiority complex develops where you’ll often see people (ie.

There’s a difference between German national pride and American national pride. Americans don’t necessarily have more national pride than Germans, but we do have more pride in the legacy of the American state, and we tend to be louder and more sensitive about it. This is based on my personal understanding, so feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.

The way I understand it, German identity and nationality is something that pre-exists the German state. Even in the time of the Holy Roman Empire, there was a German people, speaking the German language, and practicing German customs. The German state emerged from this pre-existing German people. In this way, Germany has existed for centuries, and its cultural heritage and accomplishments are somewhat separate from the actions of the German state. It’s easier for you Germans to face the legacy of the Third Reich, for instance, because you can maintain a distinction between your German nationality and any specific German government.

Americans can’t do that as easily. Before the American Revolution, there was no American people with a common American history. American identity was something forged by our independence, and it’s been constantly changing ever since. We can’t base our identity on language, culture, or ethnicity, because for the last 250 years, we’ve been expanding to include new people who speak different languages and have different cultures. Our nationality, the story we tell ourselves about who we are, has to be based in something else. We chose to base it in our values and our deeds. We are Americans because we accept American values, like liberty, equality, and justice, and our country’s heritage is our actions to further those values. 

This can make it difficult for us to confront our darker history in the way that people in other countries can. We can’t fully separate ourselves from the actions of the American state, because we haven’t yet developed another repository of our national identity. We can’t turn to a common ethnicity, language, or culture, because we don’t have one. The values that define us come from the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, the founding documents of our state. Without the American state, there is no American people. So, when people criticize or attack the legacy of the American state, we perceive it as an attack on our national identity. We get defensive about it, and we become much more willing to overlook the bad parts in order to maintain the story we tell ourselves.",86

* Follow the advice and examples of locals, they've lived here a while and know what they're doing. If you have questions, feel free to ask, Americans pride themselves on being helpful and friendly

* Life here is not like movies and TV, forget everything you've learned from that and come with an open mind, if you expect it to be like movies and TV, you're going to have a bad time.

* Likewise, remember you're an outsider looking in, there's going to be things you don't understand at first, and that's ok, just because you don't understand something does not mean it hasn't been questioned before.

* Research the state you'll be going to, they differ immensely and may not be what you're expecting. For instance, I'm from New England, which is nothing like the ""typical"" impression left by California or New York 

* Research the weather, much of the US is much colder than people expect with huge swings in temperature and weather conditions

* Travel when you get the chance, the US is huge and naturally diverse, there will be plenty to see.

* If there's something you want to do or try, just ask, your hosts will probably be eager to share life and culture with you

* Keep an open mind, the US is a big and complex place, try and discover something new

* Go to a diner

I don’t feel threatened by my existence. Being gay is not illegal (*yet* 😉). All of my friends know that I’m gay and were extremely supportive when I came out to them. Even that one right-wing friend was chill. I don’t like how the government treats my fellow LGBT people but they orchestrated that war themselves. They needed a scapegoat again and this time it was us unfortunately. What they didn’t expect though was that we would retaliate. 

Being gay in Poland isn’t ideal. In bigger cities in the western part of the country such as Warsaw, Poznań, Szczecin, Wrocław being gay is easier and people there are usually very tolerant and supportive, on par with local governments. Steps begin when you are from some rural parts in the south east where they are very religious and closed-minded. 

We can’t have civil unions, adopt children. Other discrimination is technically illegal. 

What rubs me the wrong way though is that since the government started a war with us, more and more bigots feel entitled to voice they homophobic views.

I’m personally think that change is coming though. I call our current situation as “Delayed Sexual Revolution”. Our voices are finally being heard. No other government since 1990 did anything to help our situation. The fact that there is a public debate here makes me hopeful. There are countries in the EU were public support of the LGBT community is even lower than here. 

The “LGBT ideology” that they are screaming about is just a buzz word to unite people against us. The government is all pro traditional family model so introducing same sex union means their pro-family politics wouldn’t mean anything in their minds. 

As I said, being gay in Poland is not perfect by any means but it’s also not the worst. I enjoy life to the fullest, I have fun, I have supportive friends. I just simply don’t have time for bigots and negativity. Being gay doesn’t define me as a person and I cannot let people degrade me to only sexuality. 

Also, anti-LGBT policies don’t affect my life because there aren’t any. The president said he wants to propose a constitutional change so adopting children by LGBT people would be illegal. But he would need a 2/3 of the lower house for that and PIS doesn’t have that even with all their right wing allies and Senate is 51% opposition so no way of it happening in either way.

However we also have the Scottish National Party (SNP) which are centre-left and ultimately advocate for Scottish independence - they do very well in Scotland. There are also the Liberal Democrats (centre-left to centre) who focus more on liberalism (socially and economically) and generally get around 8-12 seats each election. There are also the Greens which never get more than one seat but do tend to have the effect of making the other parties' environmental policy more robust. 

Wales has Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) which usually get 4 seats and are centre-left, I believe. Northern Ireland is a whole other kettle of fish because of its past.

In general, no the range of political views is not representative of the population because the FPTP voting system ensures two-party rule. Many people live in ""safe seats,"" meaning that their vote has basically no impact. Politicians pay much more attention to marginal constituencies because those areas are where the election is decided.

* 22nd December - Christmas lottery day. It's not an official festivity but it's undoubtedly part of the celebrations. In the morning the students of the San Ildefonso school draw the numbers of the Christmas lottery, wich is the biggest of the year and popularly known as ""el Gordo"" (the fat one). It is kind of traditional to turn on the TV or the radio to hear the rythmical calling of the numbers and know which parts of the country get the prizes.
* 24th December - Christmas Eve dinner. For most people this is the main event, when family gathers to have a feast (and I mean it literally, we usually have way too much food). The King makes a speech right before dinner which will be dissected the following day to extenuation. Old-school Catholics attend a traditional midnight mass. When there's not a plague around, younger people might go out and party instead.
* 25th December - Christmas Day lunch. While far less important than the previous dinner, it has also become quite normal to gather with extended family or friends on the 25th to have a more-special-than-usual lunch. The influence of the US has also brought us Santa Claus, who leaves small presents for children, and sometimes for adults that cannot meet on the 6th of January.
* 28th December - Innocents Day. This is the Spanish equivalente of April Fools Day. Back in the day even the public TV news joined in the fun and made funny fake reports. Nowadays pranks and jokes seem mostly confined to the Internet, and a special TV program where famous people fool other famous people for charity.
* 31st December - New Years Eve. The second biggest event, and sometimes the biggest if for some reason you couldn't make it to Christmas Eve. Depending on your age, financial status, or personal costums, you might have another feast with family or friends, you might party all night long, or you might book a dinner and dance package in a hotel or club. Quirky tradition of the night: instead of counting down loudly, we eat a grape with each of the twelve tolls of the bell at midnight, and then we wish each other a happy new year with our mouths full of mush.
* 5th and 6th of January - The Three Kings. On the afternoon of the 5th the Three Kings parade on floats in most towns and cities, often accompanied by Santa Claus, unauthorized Disney characters, relevant local institutions, advertising companies, and others. Candy are thrown out to the public from the floats, sometimes with lethal force. The presents the Magi leave are then handed and open on the 6th.",60

gv2xq3,what are the boy scouts like in your country?,267,"tl;dr: what are boy scouts like in your country?i was a boy scout for about 5 years and really enjoyed my time there. i've got lots of fond memories from that time. first i was a member of the ""wölfli"" , which is basically the junior section of the swiss boy scouts. i made a lot of good friends there. around age 11, i was ""promoted"" to the real boy scouts.when i was 18, i went on a high school exchange year to the us. during that time, i learned how incredibly different swiss and american boy scouts are. i would've never guessed.one of the most stunning differences was the general atmosphere. in switzerland, being a boy scout is first and foremost meant to be fun. we did learn some handy skills  but most of our time was spent playing games and goofing around. our leaders frequently came up with tasks and challenges loosely resembling a computer strategy game. for example we'd have to roam through the forest in small groups and find certain things, complete tasks, solve riddles etc. the whole thing was never meant to be uber-schoolmasterly though; sometimes a few boys would also just give up in the middle of the afternoon and go back to the central meeting place  to hang out. our leaders would encourage us to continue but they didn't force anything on us. by comparison, boy scouts as i saw it in america was incredibly  uptight, for lack of a better word. the main intention seemed to be to lecture boys about the importance of community work. it felt much more like military service but without weapons. everything was super strict and serious. my host brother was a boy scout and he'd do things like helping out in retirement homes or sitting in a room making packages to send them somewhere. american boy scouts didn't feel like a fun club a 12-year old would want to participate in but rather a school-like after-school activity that   parents   would want their boys to do in order to become better citizens or better christians or something like that. here in switzerland, we sometimes ran into boy scout groups from another municipality and we'd engage in completely pointless brawls. our leaders thought that was hilarious   i don't think american boy scout leaders would ever allow that.another shocking difference were the leaders themselves. here in switzerland, boy scout leaders are usually between 18-25. they can be both guys and girls. in fact, the leader-teams are usually mixed with about 2 guys and 2 girls. i loved all of my leaders; they were all awesome in their own way and they all had their unique personality. in america, most boy scout leaders seem to be middle-aged men. in fact, my host dad was a boy scout leader and he was nearly 60. i still think that's super weird. in switzerland, leaders are something like older siblings. they're authority figures but they're also your friends. there was one leader-girl who all of us boys entrusted with our love problems because she was so sweet. as a 12-year old american kid, i would've never wanted to tell some 50-year old dude about my elementary school crush. it would have felt super uncomfortable. the fact that boy scout leaders in the us are so old made the uptight, philistine, school-like atmosphere even stronger.another big difference was that american boy scouts seem to spend most of their time indoors, which really surprised me. swiss boy scouts spend almost all of their time outdoors, usually in the nature.finally, another interesting difference was that american boy scouts don't have special names. in switzerland, every boy scout has his/her special boy scout name. in fact, there's a whole ritual that you have to go through in order to receive that name. it usually includes ""surviving"" a very scary scenario, such as having to walk through the forest alone at night and getting ""abducted"" by your leaders dressed as monsters or zombies etc. it's meant to resemble an interactive, real-life nightmare that is scary but also exciting at the same time. at the end of it, you receive your nickname by which you will thenceforth be addressed and most boys are very proud of their boy scout name. in the us, all the kids were simply addressed by their regular names and when i told my host dad about those rituals where kids have to walk through the forest at night, he just stared at me like i had lost my mind.so  having said all of this, what are the boy scouts like in your country? do they resemble the ones in switzerland or are they more like the ones in the us? or something entirely different? have you ever been a boy scout? and if so, did you have a nickname? what was it? thanks for sharing  apologies for the long post.edit: thank you so much for all of your replies. i really enjoyed reading about all the different perspectives! one important correction: scouts in switzerland are in fact also mixed . i must've phrased this badly",706,2020-06-02 07:41:38,2021-05-14 16:10:11.336260,346 days 08:28:33.336267,1,"I would say Scouting Nederland lines up exactly with your description of the Swiss scouts.

Banks are awful, by I mean loans are disgusting here and by that I mean I can take you forever to pay off a loan (40-50 years for a house/mortgage) or for car (10 years or if you sell your car + loan).
We have something called “price index loansl” “index linked loans” and I think these types of loans are illegal according to EU because they are too confusing for the regular average joe to understand. (Somebody please corrode if I’m wrong here).

And similar like one Finnish dude said here somewhere, few families seem to own everything, they own the fish in the sea, own the super markets, oil service stations, real estate, and other huge companies etc and sometime seem like they are playing their own version of monopoly 🎲

So yeah these are the cons I can think of, there are some pros too of course",33

Essentially in France, when the prime minister is from the same party as the president. He doesn’t do much in my opinion. And if he does people don’t care much hard of a look because he almost always agrees with the president’s actions. 

However there have been times when the president is of a different party than the prime minister. In which case it’s called “une co-habitation”. They occurred in 1986–1988, 1993–1995, and 1997–2002. The biggest example would be with president Mitterand and Chirac. 
But usually co-habitations are not liked. The main reason is no one can get anything done effectively, because the elected government is torn.
The “co-habitations” are a product of the 5th Republic, which basically had a presidential mandate of 7 years and held legislative elections (of the National Assembly, from which the president named a Prime Minister) every 5 years. 
So you can see that over the course of a President’s mandate some people can change opinions and vote for a different party in the next elections, thus voting in a different party from the president’s. 

But this was changed in 2000 by president Chirac, when he reduced the Presidential mandate to 5 years, via referendum, thus averting the risk of a co-habitation in the future, and holding legislative elections a month after the presidential ones.",10

I kinda enjoyed watching these when sick, it was a special tradition for me.

All of these products are shit usually. But my mom and dad still has the same god damn nozzle for their vacuum cleaner that they bought, it's called Dual Action something and they've kept it and used it on 4-5 vacuum cleaners for the past 20 years. Still works like a charm.",17

They're the simplest bike you could possibly get. Just 2 wheels, 2 paddles, lights, a steering wheel and a saddle. It's quite a heavy bike. Mine is at least 10 years old and could probably survive a hurricane without a scratch. They usually fall within the category 'transport' bikes because they can handle a lot of extra baggage. 

I've also got a [Batavus Zonar Comfort](https://www.12gobiking.nl/batavus-zonar-comfort-27-2018). I don't own a car so I use it for everything else. It's a cross between the more popular city bike and a mountain bike. This way the frame is not as light and vulnerable as a mountain bike but also not as heavy as a city bike. It has 27 gears and suspension in the steering wheel and saddle (like a mountain bike) but also a luggage rack on the back wheel (like a city bike). I see these types of bikes a lot with people on cycling vacation.

As for learning how to cycle. In the Netherlands we start of pretty young. Usually around 2-3 years old with a [tiny bike and training wheels](https://www.internet-bikes.com/m/342618-amigo-flower-12-inch-215-cm-meisjes-terugtraprem-turquoise/). In my family the goal was to learn how to ride a bike before we went to elementary school at 4. We would then also get an upgrade to a big girl/boy bike for the big school. 

After we get the hang of cycling with training wheels, we take them off and parents will take their children to a quiet road, parking lot or industrial area (after 5pm) to actually learn how to cycle. After we learn how to not fall over and stop in time we get to participate in actual traffic with at least one parent with us (of course.) The tiny bike gets a [flag](https://www.bol.com/nl/p/tgl-fietsvlag-oranje-bike-fun-fietsvlag-veiligheidsvlag/9200000116468108/) so other people can't overlook it and then we start learning the rules over multiple years.

Depending on the parents and how big the family is, we get to ride to school by ourselves around 8 years old. For example, for me it was a little earlier because I had an older brother who I could cycle to school with. And I found it unfair that he could cycle to school on his own and I couldn't. 

In group 7 (10-11 years old) we take a cycling exam in school. This was in preparation for going to high school, which was in the closest big city. Depending on the high school we chose we then had to cycle 8-13 km one way. 
For the cycling exam our bike had to pass an inspection to check if it had all the mandatory things like a white front light and red back light, a bell and proper tiers. We then had to cycle a predetermined route (we could practice beforehand) with certain check points along the way where teachers and volunteers would check if you used the right hand signals, looked left-right-left and behind you etc. If we passed we got an (unofficial) diploma. I don't actually remember what happened if we failed.",128

Same in the UK, you can use ""reasonable"" force in self-defence, defence of someone else or property, to prevent a crime, or to properly arrest someone.

A difference is that we can't carry anything at all if we're intending to use it as a weapon.  So no sprays, no batons or clubs, no knives, no guns obviously.  That doesn't mean that you can't use something that you happened to have to hand as a weapon, for example you could hit someone with a walking stick, a fire extinguisher or even use a knife on someone provided it was a proportionate response to the situation.

Some people also use it (or at least used it when I was much younger haha) as a way to say that something was ""cool"", like a ""cool phone"" for instance.

As for the story, there's several of them but ultimately the core of it is the same. Germans coming over to Romania and getting wine. 

One story says that german soldiers (?) were requesting the best wine, but when they got inebriated, the romanian locals would switch the good wine for bad one so the drunk soldiers wouldn't tell the difference. Slowly catching on to the trick, the germans had one person stay completely sober to taste the wine and make sure it's still good quality and not switched - that person would be ""der Schmecker"", the taster. So soon the romanians would catch on to this and try to figure out what the hell a ""schmecker"" was, and we ended up just ""transferring"" the word altogether.

Another very similar story is with ethnic germans who lived on romanian territory that would go to a fair to buy wine, but first they would get inebriated by tasting several good wines and end up paying a lot instead for bad, low-quality wine (the switch-a-roo from before). Similarly, they caught on to this, next time around they got ""the taster"" again, story repeats.",224

That changed when the first cases of children and women occured and when Rock Hudson died. I was a teenager at the time and I recall there was much confusion about the topic, in regard of what is safe and what is not. Can HIV be transmitted by kissing for example.

In (west) Germany among teens, it was one of the most talked about topics. At the time there was MTV Europe which tried quite a lot in educating about it. Condoms had a comeback and there was also lots of advertisement in the media about using them. ""Gib AIDS keine Chance"" (don't give Aids a chance) was the german-wide campaign by the Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung (BZgA = Federal Centre for Health Education).

>In the early 1980s the first cases of AIDS became known in Germany. After controversial debates at the political level, the decision was then made to raise awareness of the virus and its transmission pathways through a ""social learning strategy"" [1] In 1987, the BZgA under Health Minister Rita Süssmuth launched the initiative ""Give AIDS no chance"". From then on, media-effective measures informed the public about HIV/AIDS and aimed at an open and self-responsible approach to the topic of HIV/AIDS. The TV spot ""Supermarket"" with Hella von Sinnen and Ingolf Lück, which was published in 1990, became very popular and produced the famous sentence ""Tina, how much do condoms cost?

Most common myth at the time was the story about ""Welcome to the Aids club"". Allegedly wrote with lipstick on your bathroom-mirror after a one night stand. Everybody knew of somebody whom it happened too.

One of my favourite jokes at the time was made by a stand up comedy group called Badesalz,

Some elaboration.

First off: How do we understand the term 'socialism'? Do we understand it in a Leninist way, as a transitionary phase between capitalism and communism? Do we understand it in a Marxist fashion as a socialist mode of production, meaning a post-capitalist society? Do we understand it in an Utopian way, as a lesser defined ""free and equal society""? Or how do we understand it?

The way that it seems that Norberg understands it, is in a way that is associated with the command economies of the old soviet system, which, it is true, Sweden experimented with in the timespan from around the 1940'es until the 1970'es.

So since the late 1970'es, the Swedish economy, the Swedish economy has been just as market oriented as most other western European states, and, since the fall of the so-called Eastern Bloc, also the 'Eastern'-European states.

So if it _isn't_ socialism, and it isn't democratic socialism? What is it then? Well... **It is capitalist**. Sweden is, as all other states on Earth, a capitalist state. Capitalism here meaning 'a society dominated by the relations of capital'. Sweden has an economy based on private property, wage labour, commodity market exchange, etc. and has had, since capitalism arose from feudal relations.

Where does the whole debacle of socialism then enter? It enters as either a deliberate rhetorical trick, or as a historical misunderstanding, or, perhaps as it often is, a little bit of both. Politicians like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, and their supporters, frame socialism (in a vulgar way) here as _merely_ the progress of class struggle, such as in the fight for unionisation, higher wages, lower hours, etc. They frame socialism as _merely_ the establishment of welfare policies for the working class. And they use this framing to... well... I actually don't really know why they do it. I must make one point very clear here: Socialism is _not_ the mere progression of the class struggle. By that logic, we should label the liberals in the British parliament in the 19th century who passed [the various factory acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_Acts) as 'socialists'... Which makes no sense!

What Sweden does have, is what sociologist Gøsta Esping-Andersen calls a 'Universal Welfare Model'. A universalistic welfare system that promotes an equality of high standards, rather than an equality of minimal needs. This implies decommodifying welfare services, to reduce the division introduced by market-based access to welfare services, as well as preemptively socialising the costs of caring for children, the aged, and the helpless, instead of then waiting until the family's capacity to support them is depleted.

Well the thing is: if you have a pipe and put one cubic metre of gas in on one side you are in essence transporting gas. You'll get approximately the same amount gas (and all the enegry therein) out on the otherside. A pipe is thus efficient even over long distances. 

If you have a cable and you put in electricity on one side you are mainly heating the cable. You'll only get out a fraction of what you put in out the other side. The longer your cable is the less efficient it is which is why long distance cables are a bad idea.",118

The EU acts like a federation in many ways - it has a Parliament with MEPs that are directly elected by the people. The MEPs vote on EU wide rules and regulations and along with the EU Council are responsible for the EU laws. The Council is made up by Ministers from all EU states and the European Commission acts like a Council of Ministers for the Union.

The EU also has its own Court, that deals with disputes between member states and/or citizens and businesses regarding EU laws.

The EU also has its own currency - the euro and its own Central Bank. It is the second most significant currency in world trade. Most EU members use it, some don't, but the goal is for all members to adopt it at some point.",19

A lot of people still believe this, that's why you see so many people saying that Eurovision is a joke. While ""voting blocks"" based on historical friendships between countries exist, they are not strong enough to guarantee a win or even a top 10 result, they just make it so that some countries will surely receive some points no matter their song (Russia, mostly), whereas others have to put more effort in their song and performance to achieve the same result (Malta for example has no countries systematically voting for them).

During WW2, the allied powers agreed on a way to split Germany into occupation zones. Since Poland and the Soviet Union had suffered so much from the war and occupation, the eastern parts were supposed to be put *under Polish/Soviet administration*. However, Stalin had other plans. Stalin wanted to annex the eastern parts of Poland into the Soviet Union, and simply give the area that was supposed to be put ""under Polish administration"" to Poland permanently, and resettle Poles from Eastern Poland there, while driving the German population out. So that's what happened.

West Germany did *not* officially acknowledge this until 1970, and even then the right wing essentially called chancellor Brandt a traitor for commiting to a peaceful settlement with Poland. It was only fully settled in 1990 with the reunification of Germany.

West German maps from before 1970 will show Germany in the borders of 1937, with the eastern areas marked as ""currently under Polish administration"", and a small part under Soviet administration.

In post war West Germany, eastern refugees were an important voter group, so all parties from left to right officially sought to reunite with those areas.

hhk03n,does irish people feel bad because they don't speak their own language?,97,english is the most spoken language in ireland even though they have their own irish language. how do you guys feel about that? is there a movement to bring it back? or everyone just doesn't care?,88,2020-06-28 18:52:42,2021-05-14 16:21:25.065541,319 days 21:28:43.065547,1,"I was raised speaking Irish so I don't feel bad, I feel sad that most Irish people don't care enough to learn it and I feel sad that the Irish language education is so bad that it doesn't produce proficient speakers. I hate that so much people (mostly Irish people but also people from the UK) have a huge amount of hostility or apathy towards Irish, which you can find on Reddit, Twitter, in newspapers and everywhere you care to look really. Even our government, while paying lip service to Irish, really don't support the existing Gaeltachtaí enough nevermind creating new Gaeltachtaí which imo is essential to any real revival.

However in my experience part of the problem (without looking at the decline of the language for historical reasons) is that a lot of Irish speakers who have great ability do a lot of gatekeeping. I've met people who were good Irish speakers but were incredibly hostile to people who were enthusiastic speakers but who didn't speak ""correct"" Irish, as in they spoke technically correctly but didn't imitate an existing dialect. I've also seen people be incredibly rude to learners, and act incredibly arrogantly towards them. Some entirely reject the standard written Irish (which personally doesn't bother me, I think a written standard is overrated) which is fine when you're dealing with fluent speakers but incomprehensible to learners and can be very off-putting. There is a tendency of some speakers to turn Discord servers for Irish language speaking into elitist clubs where if you don't agree you're mocked, some people who are like this are actually moderators on r/gaeilge unfortunately. I've seen some of these people pontificate to actual first language Irish speakers because they disagreed with them, it's bizarre.

I'm sad that this is the language will probably die due to the actions and attitudes of those with hatred and antipathy for Irish and those who seek to gatekeep Irish so hard that the number of speakers will never grow. It's just like in Irish history when the Irish were too busy fighting amongst one another to resist invasion by England or the Vikings or the British, Irish people and Irish speakers are too busy fighting amongst themselves to revive the language.

I love Irish more than anything, and if I had one wish I'd wish that every Irish person was a fluent Irish speaker, because that is the country I'd like to live in... But I can't even convince my Irish speaking siblings to use Irish, so what hope have we in reviving the language? I'll keep speaking it as long as I'm alive and have someone I can speak it to, but I don't have much hope for the language lasting and I think it'll die out as a community language within my lifetime, and that will break my heart.",36

- Unions representing the workforce
- Employee Unions representing companies
- the Swedish state, creates laws regulating the workplace and the Labour court is the highest instance for legal disputes between employees (unions) and employers (employer unions)

Unions are divided into three central organisations:

- LO (Landsorganisationen) - an umbrella organisation for blue-collar unions like IF Metall (Metalworkers union), Kommunal (employees within municiptalities) and Handelsanställdasförbund (shopkeepers) etc.

- TCO (Tjänstemännens Central Organisation) - an umbrella organisation for white-collar unions. Examples are Unionen (largest union in Sweden, organizes white-collar workers within private sector), Vision (organizes white-collar workers within the municipal sector), ST (organizes white-collar workers at state agencies), Polisförbundet (organizes police officers) etc.

- SACO (Sveriges Akademikers Central Organisation) - an umbrella organisation for unions organizing academic workers like Sveriges Ingenjörer (engineers), Sveriges läkarförbund (Doctors) and Akavia (Lawyers and people with financial degrees) etc.

TCO and SACO together are members of an organisation called PTK (Privattjänstemannakartellen) that together with LO negotiate pensions with Employer organizations.

Employer organizations are divided into three large groups:

- SN (former SAF) (Svenskt Näringsliv) - an umbrella organisation for several employer unions like Teknikföretagen (Volvo, Ericsson), Almega (private sector), Gruvnäring (mines) etc.

- SKR (Sveriges Kommuner och Regioner) - represents and organizes municipal employers.

- AGV (Arbetsgivarverket) - a state agency that organizes and represents governmental agencies.

The State:

- Riksdag (parliament) - creates laws regulating the work place

- Arbetsdomstolen (Labour court) - tries questions that are connected to labor law.

Unions and employer organizations write collective agreements regulating different questions like notice period, extra sick-pay, extra payment for prental leave, overtime etc.

Even if you are not a member of a union you will get the benefits of the collective agreement if your employer is a member of an employer organisation.

Important laws:

- Förtroendemannalagen (FML) - regulates the right of local union representatives.

- Arbetsmiljölagen (AML) - regulates employers duties regarding workplace enviroment.

- Lagen om anställningaskydd (LAS) - regulates the employees legal protection from termination.

- Medbestämmandelagen (MBL) - regulates the right of the parties (unions and employers both on central and local leves) to negotiate.

- lag om rättegång i arbetstvister- regulates how the labour court proceedings are supposed to happen.

- Föräldraledighetslagen (FL) - regulates the right to parental leave

- Semesterlagen (SemL) - regulates the vacation rights of employees.

- Sjuklönelagen (SjukL) - regulates the rights of employees during sick days 2-14.

- Diskrimineringslagen (DiskL) - protection against discrimination (based on EU directives)

- Socialförsäkringsbalken (SFB) - regulates the level of renumeration for employees who are sick from day 15- onwards as well as the remuneration for parental leave. Collective agreements usually gives employees extra monies during both times.

The right to strike:

As long as there is a collective agreement regulating a question there is ”fredsplikt” (a truce between the parties) and unions are not allowed to strike and employers are not allowed to use lock-out measures.

Collective agreements are usually timed between 1,2 or 3 years and when the times is up the parties negotiate a new collective agreement. During the negotiation  time the parties are allowed to use eventual war measures like strikes or lock-outs.

Local and central levels:

- local level of negotiation is between the employer (company) and the local union.

- central level of negotiation is between the employer organisation and the central union.

For example. At Volvo the company negotiates an importan change with the local Unionen club and the local Sveriges Ingenjörer club. At central level Teknikarbetsgivarna (representing Volvo) will negotiate with Unionen and Sveriges Ingenjörer who are represented by negotiators who are employed at the unions.

Most collecitve agreements have an order of negotiation that states when and how parties can negotiate and regulates that you can only sue to the labour court after a local and central negotiation.

Some important things to note:

Employers own their own organisation, they can whenever they want change the organisation but only after negotiation with respective union at the workplace or the unions who represents the employees who are affected by the changes. 

Changes that does not infringe on legal rights or rights based in the collective agreement can only be negotiated locally and centraly and then the employer decides what to do.

Changes that affects the legal rights of an employee can be negotiated locally and centraly and after that if there is no agreement be tried in the labour court.

Some notes on LAS:

- it is a protection against being fired but employees can still be fired
- termination of employment happens a lot because companies own their organisation they can change it at will after negotiation
- LAS regulates who will keep his job after a company decides to change their organisation. LAS protects them who has worked the longest time at the company.

The system has created a strong robust economy where unions and employer organisations ensure that the system works.

I personally really enjoyed my mandatory service, so much so that I volunteered to extend it (not doing it professionally but serving for more days than I absolutely have to). Volunteering also automatically means climbing the ranks (the number of days you serve is dependent on your rank, Eg. for privates its 245 days, for sergeants 440, generally the higher your rank the more days you serve) which also means that not everyone who wants to volunteer can actually volunteer (you absolutely cannot serve more than 245 days as a private, if you want to do more days you either have to get promoted, or at least get into training for a promotion). The reaction I mostly get when people find out I volunteered for longer service is somewhere along the line of either ""Why the f... would you do that? ""  or ""Whatever floats your boat man"". You can make a career out of it, the pay is decent so are the pensions once you're old but it's definitely only a job for a select few personality types. 

The reason I said mandatory-ish above is that while, yes, by law it's mandatory there are many ways around it, such that it's essentially voluntary by now. Only about ~~a quarter~~ *17%* (thanks for the correction) of young men actually end up doing military service (the rest do alternative service - either what we call civil service or civil protection service) .",76
kabu70,"irish/scottish/welsh people, what are some cultural differences between you and the english? what are some similarities?",51,"as an outsider it can sometimes be a bit hard to make a clear cultural distinction, so please i would like to know more about this.",73,2020-12-10 08:36:24,2021-05-14 16:23:30.257279,155 days 07:47:06.257285,1,"There is of course the historical differences, the old ""800 years of oppression"" that often gets talked about.  There is a little animosity there, but most of the rivalry is light-hearted and Irish and English people generally get on well.  We have a common language of course.  This also means a lot of British media comes into Ireland, though not so much in the other direction.  This results in Irish people being more familiar with British things like celebrities, culture, sport etc. than the other way around.  Unless they have Irish connections, a lot of British people have rarely if ever been in Ireland and have misconceptions or gaps in their knowledge about it.

People have mentioned the social aspect of events like weddings and funerals.  Even in general social things, British people are different.  The Irish are much more easy going and the atmosphere in an Irish pub is very different than in an English one.  British pubs closed earlier and people go home earlier.  I remember being in a pub in Manchester with some friends from there in the month of June on a Sunday night.  The owners called for last orders, and I remember looking up at a window and it was still daylight outside, though it was about 10pm.  As it happened, people then bought a lot of drinks, so we did end up staying for a while.

I have noticed people visiting Ireland from Britain tend to go home earlier.  I have been in pubs with British friends, having a great time, and they get up and leave, while I am sitting there thinking that things haven't really got going yet.  I have been heading to pubs in Britain, and found people already going home.  At a function in London that I was attending, we had to travel a long way and it took us a while to get there, but we didn't arrive particularly late.  We heard subsequently that one of the hosts had made a light-hearted comment that the Irish wouldn't have arrived yet earlier in the evening.

Sports are different.  We have [Gaelic Football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEAbWrdB9XU) and [Hurling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgEMvRrOCRI&t=4s) as our two main sports.  There are differences around them in that rival fans mix freely before, during and after the matches, with no segregation.  For some English soccer fans, that is very strange to them.  Rivalry is usually good fun.  Rival fans will slag each other during a game, and sometimes even argue, but when it is all over they will shake hands and wish each other well.  Fans will mix with each other in pubs talking about the game.  They may be rivals, but they have a shared love of their sports, so there is very rarely any trouble.

Senses of humour are similar, though the Irish may be slightly more easy-going.  Some English people are a bit more serious.  The northern parts of England tend to be more similar to the Irish people.  Some English people can be a bit arrogant, but most are OK.  There are a huge amount of Irish people or people of Irish descent in Britain, making for strong connections.  As we can see through the whole Brexit issue, Ireland and Britain have strong economic ties.  Together, there is a bit of ""us and them"" with regard to mainland Europe.  Scandinavians also have a bit of that mentality.

The Irish get on well with the Welsh and even moreso with the Scots, being very similar.  It is often light-heartedly said that we are united by the fact that we all hate the English.    During the Six Nations rugby tournaments, when the Scottish and Welsh come to Dublin, there is a lot of fun in the city.  It is also good with the other countries too of course.  They say though, that the Ireland v Scotland games produce the best weekends, be that in Dublin or Edinburgh.

So, despite a lot of the stereotypes and the history, the Irish and English generally do get on well.  There will of course be some people on both sides that will cause trouble, but generally that is the exception.  We make each other welcome when we visit each other.  I have been in England many times, having relations and friends there, and always have a good time.  When my relations and friends come here, I try to make sure they have a good time too.",26
